# Active Offer Course - Comprehensive Review & Feedback

## Executive Summary

Overall Course Score: 4.5/10 (Needs Significant Development)

The Active Offer course has a solid strategic framework and clear progression through the job search journey, but it currently exists primarily as a slide deck outline rather than a fully-developed high-ticket course experience. The content structure shows promise, but the course lacks the depth, engagement elements, premium delivery mechanisms, and student support systems necessary to justify high-ticket pricing and drive transformative student outcomes.

### Key Findings

- Strong foundational framework with logical module progression
- Content is primarily presentation slides without video instruction, worksheets, or interactive elements
- Missing critical high-ticket course elements: video lessons, personalized coaching touchpoints, community features, assessments, and accountability systems
- Supporting resources exist as folder placeholders but contain no actual materials
- No evidence of multi-modal content delivery or varied learning experiences
- Lacks the production quality, depth, and premium experience expected at high-ticket pricing

## Critical Missing Elements for High-Ticket Course Success

### 1. Video Content (Currently: 0/10)

**Status:** No video lessons exist - only static slide images

**Impact:** CRITICAL - This is the most significant gap preventing the course from being a true high-ticket offering. Static slides cannot deliver the transformation, engagement, or premium experience necessary for high-ticket pricing.

**Recommendations:**

- **Minimum Viable Video Content:** 30-40 core video lessons (10-15 minutes each) = 5-10 hours total video content
- **Optimal Video Content:** 60-80 video lessons covering all modules in depth = 12-18 hours total video content
- **Production Quality Standards:**
  - Professional lighting and audio (no laptop microphone/camera)
  - Clean background or branded backdrop
  - Screen recording for tool demonstrations with annotations
  - Editing to remove filler words, pauses, mistakes
  - Captions/subtitles for accessibility
  - Branded intro/outro sequences
  - Chapter markers for easy navigation

**Video Content Priorities (in order):**

1. Welcome and course orientation (M0 Intro)
2. Profile Matching framework walkthrough (M1)
3. Interview answer frameworks and examples (M3)
4. Negotiation roleplay demonstrations (M4)
5. LinkedIn optimization and outreach strategy (M2)
6. Mindset training and success habits (M0 Mindset)
7. Story crafting and delivery examples (M5)

The course currently exists as a series of static PNG slide images. This delivery model is insufficient for any paid course, let alone a high-ticket program.

### Recommended High-Ticket Delivery Model

#### 3. Structured Learning Path
- Linear progression through modules with clear milestones
- Gated content (can't skip ahead without completing prerequisites)
- Estimated time commitments visible for each section
- Flexible pacing with recommended schedule

#### 4. Content Chunking

#### 5. Engagement Mechanisms

## Pricing & Positioning Recommendations

### Current Value Delivery - $297-$497 Maximum

Based on the current state (static slides only), the course could command $297-$497 if positioned as a DIY framework/guide. However, this is not high-ticket pricing and would face significant market competition.

### High-Ticket Pricing Potential - $2,000-$5,000+

With the recommended improvements implemented, the course could justify high-ticket pricing:

**$2,000-$2,500 (Core High-Ticket Tier):**


- All video content, worksheets, and templates
- Complete resource library
- Community access
- Group coaching calls (monthly)
- Self-paced with suggested timeline
- Email support with 48-hour response

**$3,500-$4,500 (Premium Tier):**


- Everything in core tier, plus:
- 3-5 one-on-one coaching calls
- Resume and LinkedIn profile professional review
- Unlimited Q&A access
- Priority support (24-hour response)
- 6-month extended access to coaching

**$5,000-$7,500 (VIP/Done-With-You Tier):**


- Everything in premium tier, plus:
- Weekly one-on-one coaching calls
- Done-with-you implementation support
- Direct introduction facilitation to hiring managers
- Negotiation strategy calls for each offer
- Unlimited duration until offer accepted
- Personal success manager assigned

### Value Proposition for Pricing



A $200k-$500k sales role represents $1M-$2.5M in lifetime earnings over 5 years. The course fee should be positioned as:
- 1-2.5% of first-year compensation
- 0.2-0.5% of 5-year earnings potential
- Pays for itself in first commission check
- ROI: 50-250x if course helps secure target role

### Competitive Positioning



**Competitors to Study:**
- Prehired (tech sales bootcamp, $0 upfront + ISA)
- Aspireship (free training + placement)
- Sales bootcamps ($1,500-$5,000 range)
- Executive coaches ($200-$500/hour)
- Career coaches ($150-$300/hour)

**Differentiation Opportunities:**


- Specialized in sales roles (not general career coaching)
- Focused on high-income roles ($150k-$500k+)
- Comprehensive methodology from profile to offer
- Founder credibility and track record
- Proven student results and case studies
- Strategic/holistic vs. tactical/transactional

---

## Conclusion

The Active Offer course has a strong strategic foundation with clear module progression and solid content frameworks. However, it currently exists as a skeleton - an outline of what could be a transformative high-ticket program.

**The Gap:** The course is currently 15-20% developed for high-ticket standards. To justify premium pricing and deliver results worthy of testimonials and referrals, significant development is needed across content delivery, student experience, personalization, and support systems.

**The Opportunity:** With focused execution over 3-6 months, this course can become a premium offering commanding $2,000-$5,000+ pricing and genuinely delivering life-changing career and income outcomes for students.

**The Path Forward:** Prioritize video content creation, resource development, and coaching systemization in Phase 1. Then layer in engagement, community, and optimization in subsequent phases. Focus on student results above all else - the highest-converting marketing for a high-ticket course is case studies of successful students.

**Investment Required**
- Time: 200-400 hours of focused work over 3-6 months
- Money: $5,000-$15,000 for tools, platforms, equipment, and potentially outsourced support
- Resources: Consider hiring for video editing, graphic design, copywriting, and potentially coaching support

**Expected ROI**
If the course delivers on its promise, each student represents $2,000-$5,000 in revenue. With 20-50 students in year one, that's $40,000-$250,000 in revenue from a productized, scalable offering (vs. pure 1:1 coaching). The investment pays for itself with 3-10 students.

The market opportunity for helping sales professionals access high-income roles is substantial and underserved. With proper execution, Active Offer can become the definitive program in this niche and build a sustainable, impactful business.
