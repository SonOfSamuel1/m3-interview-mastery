## SECTION 1: OPENING & HOOK (Slides 1-20)

### Slide 1

Title Slide

### Slide 2

"I want to show you how I went from being ghosted by companies..."

### Slide 3

"To having the best companies and hiring managers recruit me for their top sales roles..."

### Slide 4

"In the next 45 minutes I'm going to show you exactly how you can do the same..."

### Slide 5

"But first I need to address the elephant in the room..."

### Slide 6

"Some of you might be wondering..."

### Slide 7

"Who is this guy? And why should I listen to him?"

### Slide 8

"Fair question..."

### Slide 9

"My name is Terrance Brandon, and I've been in sales for over 10 years..."

### Slide 10

"I've worked at companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce..."

### Slide 11

"But it wasn't always that way..."

### Slide 12

"In fact, there was a time when I couldn't even get a callback..."

### Slide 13

"Let alone an interview..."

### Slide 14

"And it was frustrating..."

### Slide 15

"Because I knew I had the skills..."

### Slide 16

"I knew I could do the job..."

### Slide 17

"But I just couldn't get my foot in the door..."

### Slide 18

"Sound familiar?"

### Slide 19

"Well, if it does, then you're in the right place..."

### Slide 20

"Because I'm going to show you exactly how I turned things around..."

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (Slides 21-50)

### Slide 21

"Let me ask you a question..."

### Slide 22

"How many of you have applied to 50+ jobs in the past 6 months?"

### Slide 23

"How many of you have heard back from less than 10% of those companies?"

### Slide 24

"And how many of you have gotten interviews at less than 5 of those companies?"

### Slide 25

"If you raised your hand to any of those questions..."

### Slide 26

"Then you're not alone..."

### Slide 27

"In fact, you're in the majority..."

### Slide 28

"According to recent studies..."

### Slide 29

"The average job seeker applies to 50-100+ jobs before getting an offer..."

### Slide 30

"And only hears back from about 10% of those companies..."

### Slide 31

"That's a lot of rejection..."

### Slide 32

"And a lot of wasted time..."

### Slide 33

"But here's the thing..."

### Slide 34

"It's not your fault..."

### Slide 35

"The traditional job search process is broken..."

### Slide 36

"It's designed to weed people out..."

### Slide 37

"Not let them in..."

### Slide 38

"Think about it..."

### Slide 39

"When you apply to a job online..."

### Slide 40

"You're competing with hundreds (if not thousands) of other applicants..."

### Slide 41

"All for the same position..."

### Slide 42

"And your resume?"

### Slide 43

"It gets scanned by an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)..."

### Slide 44

"Which filters out 75% of resumes before a human even sees them..."

### Slide 45

"So even if you're qualified..."

### Slide 46

"Even if you're the perfect fit..."

### Slide 47

"You might never even get a chance to prove it..."

### Slide 48

"Because your resume got lost in the black hole of online applications..."

### Slide 49

"Sound frustrating?"

### Slide 50

"It is..."

---

## SECTION 3: WHY TRADITIONAL METHODS FAIL (Slides 51-85)

### Slide 51

"But here's what most people don't realize..."

### Slide 52

"The best jobs..."

### Slide 53

"The highest paying positions..."

### Slide 54

"The roles at top companies like Google, Amazon, Salesforce..."

### Slide 55

"They're not actually looking for applicants..."

### Slide 56

"They're looking for candidates..."

### Slide 57

"What's the difference?"

### Slide 58

"Applicants apply to jobs..."

### Slide 59

"Candidates get recruited..."

### Slide 60

"Let me give you an example..."

### Slide 61

"When Google was hiring for a sales role..."

### Slide 62

"They posted the job online..."

### Slide 63

"And received over 2,000 applications..."

### Slide 64

"But do you know how many people they actually interviewed?"

### Slide 65

"Less than 20..."

### Slide 66

"And do you know how they found those 20 people?"

### Slide 67

"They didn't..."

### Slide 68

"Those 20 people were referred by employees..."

### Slide 69

"Or recruited by hiring managers..."

### Slide 70

"In other words..."

### Slide 71

"They didn't apply through the online portal..."

### Slide 72

"They went around it..."

### Slide 73

"And that's exactly what I learned to do..."

### Slide 74

"I figured out how to position myself as a candidate..."

### Slide 75

"Not an applicant..."

### Slide 76

"And it changed everything..."

### Slide 77

"Instead of sending out 100s of applications and hearing nothing back..."

### Slide 78

"I was able to get interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce..."

### Slide 79

"Without even applying online..."

### Slide 80

"In fact..."

### Slide 81

"These companies reached out to me..."

### Slide 82

"And recruited me for their openings..."

### Slide 83

"So how did I do it?"

### Slide 84

"That's what I'm going to show you today..."

### Slide 85

"But first, let me tell you my story..."

---

## SECTION 4: PERSONAL STORY & DISCOVERY (Slides 86-125)

### Slide 86

"I knew getting into a top paying sales opportunity would dramatically change my quality of life..."

### Slide 87

"But I also knew I didn't want to compete with millions of other applicants...or wait years to even get a call back for an interview..."

### Slide 88

"There had to be a better way..."

### Slide 89

"That's when I discovered a life changing idea...an idea that has led to over $1,000,000+ of additional income for myself and others..."

### Slide 90

"What if I could find a way to bring the best, highest paying opportunities to me...as opposed to going through the standard hiring process of each company?..."

### Slide 91

"I created a plan!"

### Slide 92

"I immediately put the plan into practice...all it took was 30mins a day...I did it for five days..."

### Slide 93

"By the end of the five days..."

### Slide 94

"I had interviews scheduled at Google, Amazon, and Salesforce! (the best opportunities for my skillset at the time)"

### Slide 95

"Not only this...But I also had existing employees at each of those companies begging for their team to hire me..."

### Slide 96

"I couldn't believe it...it happened very fast...and was very easy."

### Slide 97

"After thoroughly researching each of the companies, I zero'd in on the opportunity I really wanted..."

### Slide 98

"Salesforce was rated the #2 best place to work in 2021 when I was recruited to apply...This is where I wanted to be..."

### Slide 99

"Now all I had to do was ace the interview..."

### Slide 100

"Only problem was...."

### Slide 101

"I wasn't the best at interviews...and I had no idea what I actually was going to be interviewed on..."

### Slide 102

"The day had come for me to interview with Salesforce..."

### Slide 103

"Things seem to be going good...but then they begin asking me questions...one's that I weren't expecting..."

### Slide 104

"Because I wasn't fully prepared...I froze...I didn't have good responses...I wasn't fully prepared to impress the interviewers"

### Slide 105

"Ultimately this led to me not getting the job..."

### Slide 106

"This hurt..."

### Slide 107

"But probably not as much as much it hurt the millions of other applicants who apply for top opportunites..."

### Slide 108

"You see...I already figured out the key to having the best companies recruit me for the best roles on demand..."

### Slide 109

"Within a couple of days of my first interview with Salesforce...I already had multiple people recruit me for another role on another team at the company..."

### Slide 110

"This time...I felt fully prepared for the interview...because I already knew what types of questions they would be asking me..."

### Slide 111

"I knew exactly what to do to "wow" the hiring managers..."

### Slide 112

"My plan worked like a charm!"

### Slide 113

"After my first interview with the hiring manger..."

### Slide 114

"They loved me so much they fast tracked me to the last interview..."

### Slide 115

"And hired me within 6 days of the initial interview!"

## SECTION 5: RESULTS & SOCIAL PROOF (Slides 116-125)

### Slide 116

"Within my first 12months of starting the role I made over $400k in income..."

### Slide 117

### Slide 118

"And $365,000 +$40k Stock Options in 2023..."

### Slide 119

"While the money was good...The fact that I was able to dramatically lower my stress level..."

### Slide 120

"Only have to work 40hrs a week..."

### Slide 121

"And feel confident that I was finally in complete control of my career...because I now had the secret to getting the best sales opportunities in the world with ease..."

### Slide 122

"Within weeks of starting my new job (while working 100% from home)...I knew I had to share my strategy..."

### Slide 123

"I begin to document step-by-step how anyone could:

- Find and evaluate the best job opportunities for their skillset and work preferences
- Easily convince hiring mangers to recruit them for the best opportunities in the world
- Ensure they over-delivered on their job interviews
- Ensure they negotiated the best possible offer for their experience"

### Slide 124

"This eventually became version 1 of the Active Offers Methodology."

### Slide 125

"After documenting my findings...I had to test if this methodology really worked for all salespeople...and ensure that I wasn't some wired one-off anomoly"

---

### Slide 130

"I next told a buddy of mine that I volunteered with (Simon) about the methodology..."

### Slide 131

### Slide 132

"Very quickly after introducing Simon to the methodology..."

### Slide 133

"He landed a job offer of $280k, $170k more than what he was making previously!"

"Over the past couple of years we have helped several people land high paying sales jobs with this simple process..."

### Slide 136

"We've helped people get into the right boat...enabling them to not have to paddle so hard...and achieve their goals quicker..."

### Slide 137

"The sad reality of the boat anaology is that I've witnessed far worst salespeople at my new job, make more than 3x what the best salespeople were making at my previous role..."

### Slide 138

"Ultimately I've learned that the highest paid salespeople don't have the best sales skills, but work smarter not harder..."
