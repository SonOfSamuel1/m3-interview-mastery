## 🎯 TIER 1 ENHANCEMENT: Introduction Future Pacing (Slides 11A-11F)

### Slide 11A: Future Pacing Setup

"Before I show you how this works, I want you to imagine something with me for just a moment..."

**[Delivery Note: Pause. Let them settle in. This is the pattern interrupt that shifts from past-tense storytelling to present-tense imagination.]**

---

### Slide 11B: 90 Days from Now - Scene Setting

"Imagine it's 90 days from today.

You're sitting at your kitchen table.

Your laptop is open.

You have a coffee in your hand—the good kind you actually enjoy, not the break room stuff you choke down to get through the day."

**[Visual Suggestion: Image of clean, organized home workspace. Morning light. Coffee mug. Laptop with multiple email tabs open.]**

**[Delivery Note: Speak slowly. Let them build the mental picture. Use pauses between each sentence.]**

---

### Slide 11C: The Moment of Power

"You're reviewing THREE job offers.

Not one. Not 'I hope someone calls me back.'

THREE companies are actively competing for YOU.

Each offer is $80,000 to $150,000 higher than what you're making right now."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three company logos (generic or industry-representative). Three offer letters fanned out. Dollar amounts highlighted.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize "THREE" and "YOU" with vocal stress. Let the dollar amounts sink in with a pause.]**

---

### Slide 11D: The Choice

"And you get to CHOOSE.

Which company feels right?
Which role excites you?
Which comp package is best?
Which work arrangement fits your life?

YOU'RE in control. Not them. You."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split screen showing different aspects of choice - company culture, role, compensation, work-life balance icons.]**

**[Delivery Note: Rhetorical questions should be paced with pauses. Final sentence is the power statement - deliver with conviction.]**

---

### Slide 11E: The Reversal

"Hiring managers are calling YOUR references right now.

They're trying to convince YOU to join their team.

They're asking what it would take to get you to say yes.

You're not chasing them anymore. They're recruiting you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Phone screen showing incoming calls from "Google Recruiter", "Salesforce HM", "LinkedIn Talent". Flipped script visual.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the power reversal. Emphasize "YOUR", "YOU", "They're recruiting you" - this is the transformation they want.]**

---

### Slide 11F: The Feeling

"How would that feel?

That weight you've been carrying—the stress of applying to jobs and hearing nothing back, the fear that you're stuck forever—it's gone.

That's not fantasy.

That's exactly what happened to me 90 days after I figured this out.

That's what happened to Darrell. That's what happened to Simon.

And in the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to make it happen for you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After visual. Left side: stressed person at desk. Right side: confident person with offers. Social proof thumbnails of Darrell and Simon.]**

**[Delivery Note: "How would that feel?" - pause for 2-3 seconds. Let them actually feel it. Then bridge to credibility with real examples. End with promise of the webinar.]**

---

### Slide 12

"In fact, there was a time when I couldn't even get a callback..."

### Slide 13

"Let alone an interview..."

### Slide 14

"And it was frustrating..."

### Slide 15

"Because I knew I had the skills..."

### Slide 16

"I knew I could do the job..."

### Slide 17

"But I just couldn't get my foot in the door..."

### Slide 18

"Sound familiar?"

### Slide 19

"Well, if it does, then you're in the right place..."

### Slide 20

"Because I'm going to show you exactly how I turned things around..."

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (Slides 21-50)

### Slide 21

"Let me ask you a question..."

### Slide 22

"How many of you have applied to 50+ jobs in the past 6 months?"

### Slide 23

"How many of you have heard back from less than 10% of those companies?"

### Slide 24

"And how many of you have gotten interviews at less than 5 of those companies?"

### Slide 25

"If you raised your hand to any of those questions..."

### Slide 26

"Then you're not alone..."

### Slide 27

"In fact, you're in the majority..."

### Slide 28

"According to recent studies..."

### Slide 29

"The average job seeker applies to 50-100+ jobs before getting an offer..."

### Slide 30

"And only hears back from about 10% of those companies..."

### Slide 31

"That's a lot of rejection..."

### Slide 32

"And a lot of wasted time..."

### Slide 33

"But here's the thing..."

### Slide 34

"It's not your fault..."

### Slide 35

"The traditional job search process is broken..."

### Slide 36

"It's designed to weed people out..."

### Slide 37

"Not let them in..."

### Slide 38

"Think about it..."

### Slide 39

"When you apply to a job online..."

### Slide 40

"You're competing with hundreds (if not thousands) of other applicants..."

### Slide 41

"All for the same position..."

### Slide 42

"And your resume?"

### Slide 43

"It gets scanned by an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)..."

### Slide 44

"Which filters out 75% of resumes before a human even sees them..."

### Slide 45

"So even if you're qualified..."

### Slide 46

"Even if you're the perfect fit..."

### Slide 47

"You might never even get a chance to prove it..."

### Slide 48

"Because your resume got lost in the black hole of online applications..."

### Slide 49

"Sound frustrating?"

### Slide 50

"It is..."

---

## SECTION 3: WHY TRADITIONAL METHODS FAIL (Slides 51-85)

### Slide 51

"But here's what most people don't realize..."

### Slide 52

"The best jobs..."

### Slide 53

"The highest paying positions..."

### Slide 54

"The roles at top companies like Google, Amazon, Salesforce..."

### Slide 55

"They're not actually looking for applicants..."

### Slide 56

"They're looking for candidates..."

### Slide 57

"What's the difference?"

### Slide 58

"Applicants apply to jobs..."

### Slide 59

"Candidates get recruited..."

### Slide 60

"Let me give you an example..."

### Slide 61

"When Google was hiring for a sales role..."

### Slide 62

"They posted the job online..."

### Slide 63

"And received over 2,000 applications..."

### Slide 64

"But do you know how many people they actually interviewed?"

### Slide 65

"Less than 20..."

### Slide 66

"And do you know how they found those 20 people?"

### Slide 67

"They didn't..."

### Slide 68

"Those 20 people were referred by employees..."

### Slide 69

"Or recruited by hiring managers..."

### Slide 70

"In other words..."

### Slide 71

"They didn't apply through the online portal..."

### Slide 72

"They went around it..."

### Slide 73

"And that's exactly what I learned to do..."

### Slide 74

"I figured out how to position myself as a candidate..."

### Slide 75

"Not an applicant..."

### Slide 76

"And it changed everything..."

### Slide 77

"Instead of sending out 100s of applications and hearing nothing back..."

### Slide 78

"I was able to get interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce..."

### Slide 79

"Without even applying online..."

### Slide 80

"In fact..."

### Slide 81

"These companies reached out to me..."

### Slide 82

"And recruited me for their openings..."

### Slide 83

"So how did I do it?"

### Slide 84

"That's what I'm going to show you today..."

### Slide 85

"But first, let me tell you my story..."

---

## SECTION 4: PERSONAL STORY & DISCOVERY (Slides 86-99)

### Slide 86

"I knew getting into a top paying sales opportunity would dramatically change my quality of life..."

### Slide 87

"But I also knew I didn't want to compete with millions of other applicants...or wait years to even get a call back for an interview..."

### Slide 88

"There had to be a better way..."

### Slide 89

"That's when I discovered a life changing idea...an idea that has led to over $1,000,000+ of additional income for myself and others..."

### Slide 90

"What if I could find a way to bring the best, highest paying opportunities to me...as opposed to going through the standard hiring process of each company?..."

### Slide 91

"I created a plan!"

### Slide 92

"I immediately put the plan into practice...all it took was 30mins a day...I did it for five days..."

### Slide 93

"By the end of the five days..."

### Slide 94

"I had interviews scheduled at Google, Amazon, and Salesforce! (the best opportunities for my skillset at the time)"

### Slide 95

"Not only this...But I also had existing employees at each of those companies begging for their team to hire me..."

### Slide 96

"I couldn't believe it...it happened very fast...and was very easy."

### Slide 97

"After thoroughly researching each of the companies, I zero'd in on the opportunity I really wanted..."

### Slide 98

"Salesforce was rated the #2 best place to work in 2021 when I was recruited to apply...This is where I wanted to be..."

### Slide 99

"Now all I had to do was ace the interview..."

---

## 🎯 TIER 1 ENHANCEMENT: Pre-Stack Transformation Vision (Slides 99A-99D)

**[Positioning Note: These slides are inserted HERE (not at original Slide 95 position) because this is where the webinar naturally transitions from "my story" to "how you can do this." We're future pacing RIGHT BEFORE we introduce the solution/offer, which is the Perfect Webinar pattern.]**

---

### Slide 99A: "One Year from Now" (Enhanced Version)

"Before I show you what we've created, let me paint you a picture of where you'll be one year from now if you commit to this.

One year from today, you're not at the same company making the same money feeling the same frustration.

You're at a company that values you. You're making $80,000-$150,000 more per year.

But here's what nobody tells you about that raise—it's not just about the money."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline graphic showing "Today" vs "1 Year from Now". Side-by-side comparison imagery. Dollar amount prominently displayed but NOT the only focus.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the bridge from teaching to offer. Slow down. Make them feel the one-year transformation before you pitch anything.]**

---

### Slide 99B: "The Life Change"

"It's Friday at 4:45 PM.

Your coworkers are still online—they'll be grinding until 7 PM.

But you're shutting down your laptop.

Because at this company, they don't measure your value by how many hours you work. They measure your value by the results you drive.

You actually GET to have dinner with your family. On a weekday.

You're not stressed. You're not burned out. You're not wondering if there's something better out there.

Because you KNOW you're in the right place."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split scene. Left: Clock showing 4:45 PM, closed laptop, dinner table with family. Right: Other workers still at desk, stressed, late hours.]**

**[Delivery Note: This addresses the emotional "why" behind career change. Paint the lifestyle picture. Many attendees are burned out - this speaks to that pain.]**

---

### Slide 99C: "The Confidence"

"But here's the best part:

You're not worried about job security anymore.

Because you now have a skill that nobody can take away from you.

You know how to position yourself. You know how to get recruited. You know how to interview. You know how to negotiate.

If you ever wanted to leave, you could have three offers in 60 days.

That confidence—that knowing you're ALWAYS in control of your career—changes everything.

That's what this is really about."

**[Visual Suggestion: Confident person standing tall. Icons representing the skills: positioning, recruiting, interviewing, negotiating. "Always in Control" messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the meta-skill positioning. They're not just buying a job search - they're buying career control forever. Emphasize "ALWAYS in control."]**

---

### Slide 99D: "The Decision"

"So the question is:

Do you want to still be where you are now, one year from today?

Or do you want to be THERE—in that life, with that income, with that confidence?

If the answer is the second one, here's how we can help..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Fork in the road visual. Path 1: "Stay the Same" (dark, uninspiring). Path 2: "Transform" (bright, aspirational). Arrow pointing to Path 2.]**

**[Delivery Note: Binary choice. Make staying the same feel painful. Make transformation feel achievable. Then transition naturally to the stack/offer.]**

---

## SECTION 4 CONTINUED: INTERVIEW STORY (Slides 100-115)

### Slide 100

"Only problem was...."

### Slide 101

"I wasn't the best at interviews...and I had no idea what I actually was going to be interviewed on..."

### Slide 102

"The day had come for me to interview with Salesforce..."

### Slide 103

"Things seem to be going good...but then they begin asking me questions...one's that I weren't expecting..."

### Slide 104

"Because I wasn't fully prepared...I froze...I didn't have good responses...I wasn't fully prepared to impress the interviewers"

### Slide 105

"Ultimately this led to me not getting the job..."

### Slide 106

"This hurt..."

### Slide 107

"But probably not as much as much it hurt the millions of other applicants who apply for top opportunites..."

### Slide 108

"You see...I already figured out the key to having the best companies recruit me for the best roles on demand..."

### Slide 109

"Within a couple of days of my first interview with Salesforce...I already had multiple people recruit me for another role on another team at the company..."

### Slide 110

"This time...I felt fully prepared for the interview...because I already knew what types of questions they would be asking me..."

### Slide 111

"I knew exactly what to do to "wow" the hiring managers..."

### Slide 112

"My plan worked like a charm!"

### Slide 113

"After my first interview with the hiring manger..."

### Slide 114

"They loved me so much they fast tracked me to the last interview..."

### Slide 115

"And hired me within 6 days of the initial interview!"

---

## SECTION 5: RESULTS & SOCIAL PROOF (Slides 116-125)

### Slide 116

"Within my first 12months of starting the role I made over $400k in income..."

### Slide 117

"While the money was good...The fact that I was able to dramatically lower my stress level..."

### Slide 120

### Slide 121

"And feel confident that I was finally in complete control of my career...because I now had the secret to getting the best sales opportunities in the world with ease..."

### Slide 122

"Within weeks of starting my new job (while working 100% from home)...I knew I had to share my strategy..."

### Slide 123

"I begin to document step-by-step how anyone could:

- Find and evaluate the best job opportunities for their skillset and work preferences
- Easily convince hiring mangers to recruit them for the best opportunities in the world
- Ensure they over-delivered on their job interviews
- Ensure they negotiated the best possible offer for their experience"

### Slide 124

"This eventually became version 1 of the Active Offers Methodology."

### Slide 125

"After documenting my findings...I had to test if this methodology really worked for all salespeople...and ensure that I wasn't some wired one-off anomoly"

---

## SECTION 6: TESTING & VALIDATION (Slides 126-140)

### Slide 126

"I told an old college at my previous company about my great success and the methodology I used to get there..."

### Slide 127

"Within a couple weeks of our initial conversation...he had an interview lined up for one of the most esteemed roles at a top tier company..."

### Slide 128

"He quickly received an offer for $90k more than what he was currently making!"

### Slide 129

"I couldn't believe it...I had to try this again..."

### Slide 130

"I next told a buddy of mine that I volunteered with (Simon) about the methodology..."

### Slide 131

"Simon was making $90k at the time in a telesales role...Not bad, but certainly not his full potential..."

### Slide 132

"Very quickly after introducing Simon to the methodology..."

### Slide 133

"He landed a job offer of $280k, $170k more than what he was making previously!"

### Slide 134

"After teaching Darrel this skill, he used it to get a $90k raise on his first offer...And then a year later he used the same exact method to get an addional $80k raise on a new offer (with $70k stock bonus)!"

### Slide 135

"Over the past couple of years we have helped several people land high paying sales jobs with this simple process..."

### Slide 136

"We've helped people get into the right boat...enabling them to not have to paddle so hard...and achieve their goals quicker..."

### Slide 137

"The sad reality of the boat anaology is that I've witnessed far worst salespeople at my new job, make more than 3x what the best salespeople were making at my previous role..."

### Slide 138

"Ultimately I've learned that the highest paid salespeople don't have the best sales skills, but work smarter not harder..."

### Slide 139

"Now, you might be asking..."

### Slide 140

"How do I enjoy similar results?"

---

"P.R.I.N.T (...as in PRINTing Money)"

### Slide 147

"Step 1: Profile Matching"

### Slide 148

"Currently, the industry with both the most and highest paying sales opportunities is Software Sales..."

### Slide 149

"There are thousands of Software companies that offer high paying sales roles (with the number only increasing with all of the new AI companies)"

### Slide 150

"This presents both good news and bad news for salespeople..."

### Slide 151

"The GOOD NEWS is that there is MASSIVE demand for professional salesperson's skillset"

### Slide 152

"The bad news is, not all opportunities are created equal and navigating the playing field is very difficult..."

### Slide 157

"As explained with the Google example earlier, the best sales opportunities are highly coveted and near impossible to get into without help..."

- We will aim to get your initial interviews lined up for your targeted roles in less than 30 days

### Slide 160

"And also trying to learn how to make the best companies and hiring managers recruit you for the best, highest paying opportunites..."

---

## 🎯 TIER 1 ENHANCEMENT: Final Close Future Pacing (Slides 195A-195D)

**[Positioning Note: These slides replace or enhance Slide 198's generic CTA. We're making the immediate next step (booking the call) feel safe, clear, and connected to their transformation.]**

---

### Slide 195A: "Here's What Happens Next"

"When you click the button below and book your strategy call, here's what happens:

You'll pick a time that works for you—probably sometime in the next 7 days.

Between now and then, you're going to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. That's normal. That's good.

On the day of the call, you'll hop on Zoom with me.

We're going to map out your exact situation—where you are now, where you want to be, what's been holding you back.

And within 45 minutes, you'll have complete clarity."

**[Visual Suggestion: Simple process flow. Step 1: Click button. Step 2: Pick time. Step 3: Zoom call. Step 4: Clarity. Clean, reassuring design.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove fear and uncertainty about what happens next. Make it concrete and safe. Acknowledge their emotions ("excitement and nervousness") to normalize them.]**

---

### Slide 195B: "How You'll Feel After"

"You'll walk away from that call feeling one of two things:

EITHER: 'This isn't the right fit for me right now'—and you'll have a clear roadmap of what to do instead. That's valuable.

OR: 'This is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm ready to commit.'

And if that's you, we'll map out your next 90 days together.

You'll know exactly what you're getting. You'll know exactly what success looks like. You'll know you're making the right decision.

No pressure. No manipulation. Just clarity."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two paths branching from the call. Path 1: "Clear Roadmap" (still valuable). Path 2: "90-Day Plan" (ideal outcome). Both paths show value.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the qualification frame that removes sales pressure. They win either way. Emphasize "No pressure. No manipulation. Just clarity." - this builds trust.]**

---

### Slide 195C: "45 Days After That Call"

"And 45 days after that call—if you decide to work with us—you'll be sitting in your first interview with a company that's excited to meet you.

Not because you applied online and got lucky.

Because you positioned yourself strategically and they recruited you.

That's when you'll know this was the right decision."

**[Visual Suggestion: Calendar showing "Day 1: Strategy Call" → "Day 45: First Interview". Interview scene with confident candidate and engaged interviewer. Checkmark: "They recruited YOU."]**

**[Delivery Note: Future pace beyond the call to the first tangible result. 45 days is specific and believable. Reinforce the positioning/recruitment framework.]**

---

### Slide 195D: Final CTA

"So click the button below.

Book your call.

Let's see if this is right for you.

I'll see you on the other side."

[CTA Button: "CLICK HERE TO BOOK YOUR STRATEGY CALL"]

**[Visual Suggestion: Clean, prominent CTA button. Three red arrows pointing down (as in original Slide 198). Simple, uncluttered design. Optional: Timer showing "Limited Strategy Call Slots Available This Week"]**

**[Delivery Note: Simple, direct, low-pressure. "Let's see if this is right for you" maintains qualification frame. "I'll see you on the other side" creates inevitability and connection.]**

---

### Slide 198 (Original Final CTA - Keep as Backup/Reinforcement)

"CLICK THE BUTTON BELOW, BOOK A CALL, AND APPLY TO SEE IF YOU'RE A GOOD FIT FOR THE ACTIVE OFFER PROGRAM"

[Three red arrows pointing down to CTA buttons]

**[Implementation Note: You can either replace Slide 198 with 195A-195D, OR keep both - using 195A-195D as the primary close and 198 as a reinforcement slide. Testing will determine which performs better.]**

## KEY TALKING POINTS SUMMARY (ORIGINAL CONTENT PRESERVED)

### Core Problem

- Traditional job applications have a 10% response rate
- 75% of resumes filtered out by ATS systems
- Average job seeker applies to 50-100+ jobs before getting an offer

- Best opportunities go to referred candidates, not applicants

### Solution Overview

- Position yourself as a candidate, not an applicant
- Get companies to recruit you instead of applying online
- Use the P.R.I.N.T methodology for systematic success

### Personal Results

- Started at top companies (Google, Amazon, Salesforce)
- Made $400k+ in first 12 months
- $516,000 in 2022
