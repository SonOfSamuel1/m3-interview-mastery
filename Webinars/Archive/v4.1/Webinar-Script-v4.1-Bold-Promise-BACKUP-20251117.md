## THE BIG DOMINO (Core Thesis)

**"Once you understand that your income as a salesperson is determined by WHERE you're positioned in the market, not HOW HARD you work—and once you realize that positioning is a learnable skill anyone can master—then increasing your annual income by $75K-$125K becomes a systematic process, not a prayer."**

This single belief, once accepted, makes the entire methodology logical and inevitable.

## SECTION 1: OPENING & HOOK (Slides 1-8)

### Slide 1
Title Slide: **"How to Increase Your Annual Income by $75K-$125K in 90 Days or Less (Without Applying Online)"**

**[Visual Suggestion: Clean, professional title slide. Income range prominently displayed. Subtext: "A Proven System for Experienced Sales Professionals".]**

**[Delivery Note: The title now leads with the income promise, which is more tangible and believable than role-based promises.]**

---

### Slide 2
"I want to show you how I went from being ghosted by companies..."

---

### Slide 3
"To having the best companies and hiring managers recruit me for their top sales roles..."

---

## SECTION 1A: BOLD PROMISE - INCOME-FOCUSED PROGRESSIVE REVEAL (NEW - Slides 4A-4E)

### Slide 4A: Promise Setup
"In the next 60 minutes, I'm going to show you how to increase your annual income..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Simple text slide. "In the next 60 minutes..." text. Build anticipation. Clean design.]**

**[Delivery Note: Pause slightly after this slide. Let them lean in. You're building to the income reveal.]**

---

### Slide 4B: Income Promise Reveal (THE HERO MOMENT)
"...by $75,000 to $125,000..."

**[Visual Suggestion: LARGE, BOLD NUMBERS dominating the screen. "$75,000 to $125,000" in huge font. High contrast. This number needs to land with maximum visual impact. Minimal other text.]**

**[Delivery Note: SLOW DOWN. Let this number LAND. Pause for 2-3 seconds after saying it. This is the moment that hooks them. The visual and your voice need to make this number feel real and achievable.]**

---

### Slide 4C: Timeframe Constraint
"...in the next 90 days or less..."

**[Visual Suggestion: "90 Days or Less" text. Calendar visual showing 3-month timeline. "FAST RESULTS" emphasis.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize "90 days or less" - this removes the "it takes years" objection immediately. Speed is a benefit.]**

---

### Slide 4D: Method Constraints (Removes Objections)
"...without applying online, without recruiters, and without quitting your job..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three X-marks through common objections: "No Online Applications ✗", "No Recruiters ✗", "No Quitting ✗". "A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: Each constraint removes a fear/objection. This isn't the frustrating path they've tried before - it's different.]**

---

### Slide 4E: System Promise (Effort Commitment)
"...using a proven system that takes just 30 minutes per day."

**[Visual Suggestion: "30 Minutes Per Day" prominently displayed. Clock icon. "PROVEN SYSTEM" with checkmarks from previous success stories (brief icons/logos, no names yet).]**

**[Delivery Note: "30 minutes per day" makes it feel achievable. "Proven system" creates credibility. You'll prove this throughout the webinar.]**

---

## SECTION 1B: CREDIBILITY SETUP (Slides 5-8)

### Slide 5
"But first I need to address the elephant in the room..."

---

### Slide 6
"Some of you might be wondering..."

---

### Slide 7
"Who is this guy? And why should I listen to him?"

---

### Slide 8
"Fair question..."

---

## SECTION 2: CREDIBILITY ESTABLISHMENT (Slides 9-12)

### Slide 9
"My name is Terrance Brandon, and I've been in sales for over 10 years..."

---

### Slide 10
"I've worked at companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce..."

**[Delivery Note: Establish baseline credibility but don't oversell yet. The epiphany bridges will do the heavy lifting.]**

---

### Slide 11
"But it wasn't always that way..."

**[Delivery Note: This is the transition to contrast - setting up for your transformation story]**

---

### Slide 12
"In fact, just a few years ago, I was stuck at AT&T making $130,000 a year after 10 years of hard work..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before state image. AT&T logo. "$130K after 10 years" text. Stressed person at desk.]**

**[Delivery Note: Introduce the "before" state to create contrast with transformation]**

---

## TIER 1 FUTURE PACING: Introduction (Slides 13A-13F)

### Slide 13A: Future Pacing Setup
"Before I tell you my story, I want you to imagine something with me for just a moment..."

**[Delivery Note: Pause. Let them settle in. This is the pattern interrupt that shifts from past-tense storytelling to present-tense imagination.]**

---

### Slide 13B: 90 Days from Now - Scene Setting
"Imagine it's 90 days from today.

You're sitting at your kitchen table.

Your laptop is open.

You have a coffee in your hand—the good kind you actually enjoy, not the break room stuff you choke down to get through the day."

**[Visual Suggestion: Image of clean, organized home workspace. Morning light. Coffee mug. Laptop with multiple email tabs open.]**

**[Delivery Note: Speak slowly. Let them build the mental picture. Use pauses between each sentence.]**

---

### Slide 13C: The Moment of Power
"You're reviewing THREE job offers.

Not one. Not 'I hope someone calls me back.'

THREE companies are actively competing for YOU.

Each offer is $80,000 to $150,000 higher than what you're making right now."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three company logos (generic or industry-representative). Three offer letters fanned out. Dollar amounts highlighted.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize "THREE" and "YOU" with vocal stress. Let the dollar amounts sink in with a pause.]**

---

### Slide 13D: The Choice
"And you get to CHOOSE.

Which company feels right?
Which role excites you?
Which comp package is best?
Which work arrangement fits your life?

YOU'RE in control. Not them. You."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split screen showing different aspects of choice - company culture, role, compensation, work-life balance icons.]**

**[Delivery Note: Rhetorical questions should be paced with pauses. Final sentence is the power statement - deliver with conviction.]**

---

### Slide 13E: The Reversal
"Hiring managers are calling YOUR references right now.

They're trying to convince YOU to join their team.

They're asking what it would take to get you to say yes.

You're not chasing them anymore. They're recruiting you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Phone screen showing incoming calls from "Google Recruiter", "Salesforce HM", "LinkedIn Talent". Flipped script visual.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the power reversal. Emphasize "YOUR", "YOU", "They're recruiting you" - this is the transformation they want.]**

---

### Slide 13F: The Feeling
"How would that feel?

That weight you've been carrying—the stress of applying to jobs and hearing nothing back, the fear that you're stuck forever—it's gone.

That's not fantasy.

That's exactly what happened to me.

And in the next 60 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to make it happen for you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After visual. Left side: stressed person at desk. Right side: confident person with offers. "This Can Be You" messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: "How would that feel?" - pause for 2-3 seconds. Let them actually feel it. Then bridge to credibility with real examples.]**

---

### Slide 14
"But I need to be honest with you..."

---

### Slide 15
"Getting to where I am today required me to completely change the way I thought about career advancement..."

---

### Slide 16
"I had to let go of everything I was taught about 'working hard' and 'paying my dues'..."

---

### Slide 17
"And I had to embrace a completely different approach..."

---

### Slide 18
"An approach that most people never discover..."

---

### Slide 19
"But once you see it, you can't unsee it..."

---

### Slide 20
"So let me show you what I discovered. Let me tell you my story..."

**[Delivery Note: This transitions into Secret #1's epiphany bridge]**

---

## SECRET #1: THE VEHICLE (Slides 21-50)
### **"Why Strategic Positioning Beats Traditional Job Search"**

**Purpose:** Break the FALSE BELIEF that "working harder and improving skills = more income"
**Replace With:** TRUE BELIEF that "positioning in the right market = more income with same skills"

---

### Slide 21: Secret #1 Introduction
"The first thing you need to understand is this:

Your income has nothing to do with how good you are at sales.

Let me tell you the story of how I learned this the hard way..."

**[Visual Suggestion: "Secret #1" header. Subtitle: "Why Where You Sell Matters More Than How Well You Sell".]**

**[Delivery Note: Introduce Secret #1 as a revelation, not just information. Build anticipation.]**

---

## EPIPHANY BRIDGE #1: The Income Discovery (Aha Moment #1)

### Slide 22: The Before State (AT&T Era)
"It was 2021.

I'd been at AT&T for 10 years.

I'd worked my way up from $65,000 to $130,000.

I was proud of that. It felt like progress."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline showing 2011-2021. AT&T logo. Income progression: $65K → $130K. "10 Years of Hard Work" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the pride but also set up the plateau. Make them relate to feeling stuck despite working hard.]**

---

### Slide 23: The Plateau
"But here's what I didn't realize:

After 10 years of loyalty, after being a top performer, after giving everything to that company...

$130,000 was my ceiling.

That was as far as I could go."

**[Visual Suggestion: Graph showing income growth leveling off. Ceiling visualization. "$130K = THE CAP" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize the word "ceiling." This is the pain point many in your audience are experiencing.]**

---

### Slide 24: The Pain
"And it wasn't enough.

I had debt I couldn't get out of.

My wife wanted to stay home with our daughter, but we couldn't afford it.

I was working long hours, stressed, and watching other people pass me by."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split screen showing pain points: debt bills, family time missed, long work hours, career stagnation.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make this personal. They need to feel your pain to connect emotionally before the breakthrough.]**

---

### Slide 25: The Overlooked Promotion
"And then, in 2021, I got passed over for a promotion.

Again.

I was a top performer. Everyone knew it.

But it didn't matter."

**[Visual Suggestion: "PROMOTION DENIED" visual. Despite "TOP PERFORMER" badge shown.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the lowest point. The moment before the discovery. Build the tension.]**

---

### Slide 26: The Inciting Incident
"Then one random day in the office, I overheard two coworkers talking.

They were talking about a guy who used to work with us. Someone who'd left AT&T a year earlier.

And one of them said: 'Yeah, I heard he's making over $400,000 now at some software company.'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Office scene. Two people talking (silhouettes). Speech bubble: "$400,000". Listener's shocked face.]**

**[Delivery Note: Slow down on "$400,000." Let it land. This is the moment that changes everything.]**

---

### Slide 27: The Shock
"I almost fell out of my chair.

$400,000?

This was a guy I'd worked with. We had similar skills. Similar work ethic.

I'd even outperformed him when we worked together."

**[Visual Suggestion: Comparison visual. "You" vs. "Former Colleague". Same skills. Same work ethic. But: "$130K" vs. "$400K".]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize the comparison. They had the SAME skills. This is the key insight coming.]**

---

### Slide 28: The Question
"So I asked myself:

'How is he pulling this off?

I was pretty good at what I did, but I barely cracked $150,000 in my best year.

How is he making $400,000?'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Big question mark. "$130K vs. $400K" comparison. "What's the Difference?" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: This question is the turning point. Make them wonder with you.]**

---

### Slide 29: The Rabbit Hole
"So I went down a rabbit hole.

I spent the next two weeks researching top sales roles industry-wide.

Google. Amazon. Salesforce. Snowflake. All the top tech companies.

And what I discovered changed my life forever."

**[Visual Suggestion: Research montage. Multiple company logos. LinkedIn profiles. Salary data. "The Discovery" headline.]**

**[Delivery Note: Build anticipation. They're about to learn what you discovered.]**

---

### Slide 30: The Discovery
"I discovered that average salespeople at top companies were making hundreds of thousands of dollars more than top performers at companies like AT&T.

Not because they were better at sales.

Not because they worked harder.

But because they worked at companies that PAY MORE for the same work."

**[Visual Suggestion: Salary comparison chart. "Average at Top Tech" ($300K-$500K) vs. "Top Performer at Traditional" ($130K-$200K). Same skills, different markets.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the first articulation of the positioning concept. Emphasize "same work, different pay."]**

---

### Slide 31: The Big Domino Reveal
"And that's when it hit me:

**Your income isn't determined by how good you are at sales.

Your income is determined by WHO is hiring you and WHICH market you're in.**

It's not about performance. It's about positioning."

**[Visual Suggestion: THE Big Domino visual. One large domino labeled "POSITIONING" standing. Text: "The One Belief That Changes Everything".]**

**[Delivery Note: THIS IS THE BIG DOMINO MOMENT. Slow down. Pause after the statement. Let it sink in. This is the most important slide in Secret #1.]**

---

### Slide 32: The Belief Shift
"Everything I'd been taught was wrong.

They told me: 'Work hard, and you'll get ahead.'

But that's not true.

The role you're in matters MORE than how hard you work."

**[Visual Suggestion: "OLD BELIEF" crossed out: "Work Harder = Earn More". "NEW BELIEF" highlighted: "Better Position = Earn More".]**

**[Delivery Note: Challenge their existing worldview. This is belief-breaking at work.]**

---

### Slide 33: The Boat Analogy Introduction
"Let me give you an analogy that makes this crystal clear:

Imagine you're paddling a canoe as hard as you can.

You're sweating. You're exhausted. You're giving it everything you've got.

And you're going 10 miles per hour."

**[Visual Suggestion: Person paddling canoe intensely. Sweating. Exhausted. "10 mph" speed indicator. "MAXED OUT" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Create the visual. Make them see themselves in that canoe, paddling hard.]**

---

### Slide 34: The Boat Analogy - The Upgrade
"Now imagine you take that same person, with that same effort, that same work ethic...

And you put them in a speedboat.

Suddenly they're going 60 miles per hour.

Same person. Same effort. Different vehicle. 6x results."

**[Visual Suggestion: Same person, now in speedboat. Relaxed. "60 mph" speed indicator. "SAME EFFORT, BETTER VEHICLE" text. Visual shows 6x difference.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize "SAME PERSON, SAME EFFORT." The only variable that changed was the boat. This is the positioning principle illustrated.]**

---

### Slide 35: The Boat Analogy - Application to Sales
"That's what I realized about sales careers:

If you're at AT&T making $130,000, you're in a canoe.

If someone's at Salesforce making $500,000, they're in a speedboat.

**It's not that they're better at sales than you. They're just in a better boat.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two salespeople side by side. Left: AT&T (canoe), $130K, working hard. Right: Salesforce (speedboat), $500K, same effort. Text: "Better Boat, Not Better Skills".]**

**[Delivery Note: This application makes the analogy personal. "They're just in a better boat" should hit hard.]**

---

### Slide 36: Teaching - Why This Matters
"Once I understood this principle—once I accepted that it's about WHERE you sell, not HOW WELL you sell—everything changed.

I stopped trying to be a better salesperson.

I started trying to be a better-POSITIONED salesperson.

And that's when the $80K-$150K raises became possible."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After mindset shift. Before: "Improving skills" (treadmill, going nowhere). After: "Improving position" (escalator, effortless elevation to "$300K+ roles").]**

**[Delivery Note: Bridge from insight to action. "Better-positioned salesperson" is the key phrase. This shows positioning is actionable.]**

---

### Slide 37: Teaching - The Three Positioning Factors
"So what determines your positioning?

It comes down to three things:

1. **WHO is hiring you** - Which company, which market segment
2. **WHICH roles you target** - The level, the comp structure, the opportunity
3. **HOW you position yourself** - How you get in front of hiring managers

Get these three things right, and your income can double or triple with the same skills you have today."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three pillars showing the positioning factors. Each pillar labeled: WHO, WHICH, HOW. Foundation text: "Strategic Positioning".]**

**[Delivery Note: Break down the positioning principle into actionable components. This makes it feel systematic and learnable.]**

---

### Slide 38: Teaching - It's Not About Luck
"Now here's the good news:

Positioning is NOT about luck.

It's NOT about connections.

It's NOT about having an Ivy League degree.

**Positioning is a skill. And skills can be learned.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Checklist with Xs through "Luck", "Connections", "Ivy League Degree". Checkmark next to "Strategic Positioning" with "LEARNABLE SKILL" in bold.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove objections preemptively. This addresses their internal resistance: "I don't have connections, I'm not lucky, I don't have the pedigree." Show them NONE of that matters.]**

---

### Slide 39: Teaching - What Strategic Positioning Looks Like
"Strategic positioning means:

Instead of sending out 100 applications and hoping someone notices you...

You identify the 5-10 companies that pay $300K+ for your skillset.

Instead of competing with 2,000 other applicants...

You get in front of hiring managers BEFORE they post the job publicly.

Instead of being an applicant...

You become a candidate they're recruiting."

**[Visual Suggestion: Side-by-side comparison. "OLD WAY (Applicant)" vs. "NEW WAY (Positioned Candidate)". Show the strategic differences.]**

**[Delivery Note: Paint the contrast. Make the new way sound not just better, but SMARTER. This is working smarter, not harder.]**

---

### Slide 40: Proof - The Google Example
"Let me give you a real example of how this works:

When Google posts a sales role online, they receive over 2,000 applications.

But do you know how many people they actually interview?

Less than 20.

That's a 1% interview rate if you apply online."

**[Visual Suggestion: Funnel visual. "2,000 Applicants" at top. Narrow funnel. "20 Interviews" at bottom. "1% Interview Rate" highlighted. "Online Application = 99% Rejection".]**

**[Delivery Note: Let these numbers sink in. 2,000 applicants vs. 20 interviews. This shows the futility of the traditional approach.]**

---

### Slide 41: Proof - The Google Example (continued)
"But here's what most people don't know:

Those 20 people who got interviewed?

Most of them DIDN'T apply online.

They were referred by employees.

They were recruited by hiring managers.

They were positioned as candidates, not applicants."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two paths to Google interview. Path 1 (Online Application): 2,000 applicants, 99% filtered out. Path 2 (Positioning/Referrals): 20 candidates, 100% interview rate. Path 2 highlighted.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show them there are TWO games being played. The positioning game has a 100% interview rate vs. the application game's 1% rate.]**

---

### Slide 42: Proof - Your Personal Transformation
"Once I understood this, I made a decision:

I was going to figure out how to get into one of those 'better boats.'

Not by applying online like everyone else.

But by positioning myself so companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce would WANT to recruit me."

**[Visual Suggestion: Decision point visual. Fork in the road. Path 1 (dimmed): "Keep applying online". Path 2 (highlighted): "Learn strategic positioning". Arrow pointing to Path 2.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show your decision point. This is where you committed to mastering positioning.]**

---

### Slide 43: Proof - The Result
"And it worked.

Within a year, I went from AT&T making $130,000...

To Salesforce making over $514,000 my first full year.

Same skills. Same work ethic. Same effort.

**Different positioning. 4x income.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After transformation. Before: AT&T, $130K, 10 years, canoe visual. After: Salesforce, $514K, 1 year, speedboat visual. "4x Income" highlighted. "SAME SKILLS, BETTER POSITIONING" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is your proof of concept. Emphasize "SAME SKILLS" to drive home that positioning, not performance improvement, was the variable that changed.]**

---

### Slide 44: Proof - The Lifestyle Change
"But it wasn't just about the money.

At AT&T, I was working 60-hour weeks.

At Salesforce, I work 40-hour weeks.

I have dinner with my family every night.

My wife got to stay home with our daughter.

We got out of debt."

**[Visual Suggestion: Lifestyle comparison. Left: AT&T (stressed, 60hr/wk, missed family time, debt). Right: Salesforce (relaxed, 40hr/wk, family dinners, financial freedom). Text: "Better Positioning = Better Life".]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the full transformation. Income is the hook, but lifestyle is the real motivator for many. Make them feel what life could be like.]**

---

### Slide 45: Secret #1 Summary - The Vehicle Belief
"So here's what I want you to understand from Secret #1:

Your income is not determined by how good you are at sales.

Your income is determined by your market positioning.

**Get into the right boat, and the same effort that got you $130,000 can get you $500,000.**

That's the power of strategic positioning."

**[Visual Suggestion: Key takeaway box. "Secret #1: Positioning > Performance". Boat analogy visual reinforcement. "Your boat determines your income" subtext.]**

**[Delivery Note: Summarize Secret #1. Restate the Vehicle belief one more time. This belief must be LOCKED IN before moving to Secret #2.]**

---

### Slide 46: Transition to Secret #2
"Now, you might be thinking:

'Okay Terrance, that's great for you. You figured it out.

But can I do this? I don't have your background. I don't have connections at Google.

What if I'm not qualified for those $300K+ roles?'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Thought bubbles showing audience objections: "Not qualified enough", "No connections", "Don't have the background", "This won't work for me".]**

**[Delivery Note: Voice their objections out loud. This shows you understand their doubts. Secret #2 will systematically destroy these internal beliefs.]**

---

### Slide 47: Transition Continued
"I get it.

I had the same doubts.

But let me tell you something that's going to blow your mind..."

---

### Slide 48: Transition - Building Anticipation
"You already have everything you need to get recruited for $300K+ roles.

You don't need better skills.

You don't need an MBA.

You don't need connections.

**You just need to position what you already have correctly.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: "YOU ALREADY HAVE:" checklist showing: "Experience ✓", "Skills ✓", "Track Record ✓". "YOU DON'T NEED:" showing: "MBA ✗", "Connections ✗", "More Skills ✗". Text: "You're Qualified. You're Just Mis-Positioned.".]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the bridge to Secret #2. Build belief that they CAN do this. They're qualified, they're just positioning incorrectly.]**

---

### Slide 49: Preview Secret #2
"Let me tell you the story of how I learned this lesson..."

---

### Slide 50: Secret #2 Title Card
**SECRET #2**

**"You Already Have Everything You Need - Positioning Is Learnable"**

**[Visual Suggestion: "Secret #2" header. Subhead: "Why Preparation Beats Natural Talent". Clean, bold design.]**

**[Delivery Note: Pause. Reset energy. Each secret should feel like a new chapter with its own revelation.]**

---

## SECRET #2: INTERNAL BELIEFS (Slides 51-75)
### **"You Already Have Everything You Need - Positioning Is Learnable"**

**Purpose:** Break the FALSE BELIEF that "I'm not qualified for $300K+ roles"
**Replace With:** TRUE BELIEF that "I'm already qualified - I just need to position my skills correctly"

---

## EPIPHANY BRIDGE #2: The Interview Mastery (Aha Moment #3)

### Slide 51: Setting Up the Story
"So I'd figured out Secret #1: positioning beats performance.

I'd identified my target companies: Google, Amazon, Salesforce.

I'd created a plan to get in front of hiring managers.

And it worked. Within a week, I had interviews scheduled at all three companies."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline showing progression. "Week 1: Created positioning strategy" → "Week 2: Implemented plan" → "Week 3: 3 INTERVIEWS SCHEDULED". Three company logos with checkmarks.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the success of Secret #1. Set up the contrast with the upcoming failure.]**

---

### Slide 52: The Confidence
"I was on top of the world.

I thought: 'I figured it out. I beat the system. I'm getting interviews at the best companies in the world.'

I felt unstoppable."

**[Visual Suggestion: Confident person. Three interview invitations on screen. "TOP OF THE WORLD" feeling illustrated.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the confidence bordering on overconfidence. Set up for the fall.]**

---

### Slide 53: The Reality Check
"And then came the Salesforce interview.

It was my first interview with a top-tier tech company.

I walked in feeling confident.

And I completely bombed it."

**[Visual Suggestion: Interview room. Confident walk-in visual transitioning to disaster visual. "INTERVIEW: FAIL" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Drop the energy. Show the crash from confidence to failure. Make it visceral.]**

---

### Slide 54: The Bomb
"They asked me questions I wasn't prepared for.

Questions I'd never heard in traditional sales interviews.

Questions about deal structure, multi-threading, value frameworks.

I froze. I stumbled. I gave weak answers."

**[Visual Suggestion: Interview questions appearing on screen, each more complex than the last. Candidate's confused face. "NOT PREPARED" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make them feel the embarrassment and fear. This is a low point that many can relate to.]**

---

### Slide 55: The Rejection
"A week later, I got the email:

'Thank you for your interest, but we've decided to move forward with other candidates.'

Rejected.

I'd beaten the odds to GET the interview.

And then I blew it."

**[Visual Suggestion: Rejection email on screen. "We've decided to move forward with other candidates" text highlighted. Defeated person reading it.]**

**[Delivery Note: Sit in the pain for a moment. Let them feel the disappointment.]**

---

### Slide 56: The Doubt
"And all my old doubts came rushing back:

'Maybe I'm not qualified for these roles after all.'

'Maybe I'm out of my league.'

'Maybe I should just stay at AT&T and be grateful for what I have.'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Thought bubbles showing doubt statements. Person looking defeated and uncertain. "Impostor Syndrome" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Voice the internal beliefs they're having right now: "I'm not qualified." This is the belief Secret #2 will destroy.]**

---

### Slide 57: The Second Chance
"But here's what's crazy:

Within three days of that rejection, I got another message.

It was from a different hiring manager at Salesforce.

For a different team.

They wanted to interview me."

**[Visual Suggestion: New message notification. Different hiring manager. Different role. "SECOND CHANCE" text. Surprised face.]**

**[Delivery Note: Build surprise. This is unexpected. The positioning strategy is working even when interviews fail.]**

---

### Slide 58: The Realization
"And that's when it hit me:

My positioning strategy was working.

I wasn't failing to GET interviews. That part was easy once I had the positioning down.

**I was failing to WIN interviews. And that was a completely different skill.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two-layer positioning visual. Layer 1: "External Positioning" (checkmark - "Got interviews"). Layer 2: "Interview Positioning" (X - "Not prepared"). Gap highlighted.]**

**[Delivery Note: Articulate the distinction. External positioning (getting recruited) vs. internal positioning (interview preparation). Both are positioning skills.]**

---

### Slide 59: The Decision
"So I made another decision:

I was NOT going to bomb this second interview.

I was going to figure out exactly what these companies were looking for.

I was going to prepare like I'd never prepared before.

And I was going to position myself as the OBVIOUS choice."

**[Visual Suggestion: Determined person at desk. Research materials. Preparation checklist. "THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the commitment. This is where positioning becomes intentional preparation, not winging it.]**

---

### Slide 60: The Preparation
"So I spent the next week preparing.

I researched what Salesforce was hiring for.

I studied the team's challenges.

I prepared specific examples that positioned my experience as the exact solution they needed.

I practiced answering their questions until I could do it in my sleep."

**[Visual Suggestion: Preparation montage. Research notes. Practice sessions. Examples mapped to job requirements. "INTERVIEW POSITIONING" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the work. Positioning isn't magic—it's preparation. It's systematic.]**

---

### Slide 61: The Interview Redux
"And when I walked into that second interview?

It was completely different.

They asked tough questions—but this time, I was ready.

Every answer positioned me as someone who understood their problems and had solved them before.

Every example was tailored to what THEY needed, not just what I'd done."

**[Visual Suggestion: Confident interview. Prepared answers flowing smoothly. Interviewers nodding. "POSITIONED FOR SUCCESS" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Contrast this with the first interview. Same person, different preparation. This is positioning at work.]**

---

### Slide 62: The Result
"At the end of the interview, the hiring manager said:

'I don't need to see anyone else. You're exactly what we're looking for.'

They fast-tracked me to the final interview.

And six days later, I was hired."

**[Visual Suggestion: Hiring manager's quote in large text. "Six Days: Application → Hired" timeline. "SUCCESS" banner.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the speed. Six days from interview to hire. This shows what happens when positioning is right.]**

---

### Slide 63: The Lesson - Positioning Is Learnable
"Here's what I learned from this experience:

The difference between bombing the first interview and crushing the second wasn't my skills.

I had the same skills both times.

**The difference was my positioning. And positioning is LEARNABLE.**

It's not talent. It's preparation."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After comparison. Interview #1: "Same Skills, Poor Positioning = FAIL". Interview #2: "Same Skills, Strong Positioning = HIRED". Equation visual: "Skills + Positioning = Success".]**

**[Delivery Note: THIS IS THE SECRET #2 BIG REVEAL. Positioning (preparation) beats natural talent. This belief shift is critical.]**

---

### Slide 64: Teaching - You're Already Qualified
"So let me tell you something you need to hear:

You're already qualified for $300K+ roles.

You have the skills. You have the experience. You have the track record.

**You're not under-qualified. You're under-POSITIONED.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: "YOU ARE QUALIFIED" in large text. Checklist showing: "Experience ✓", "Skills ✓", "Results ✓". Text: "The Problem Isn't Your Skills. It's Your Positioning.".]**

**[Delivery Note: Speak directly to their impostor syndrome. Destroy the "I'm not qualified" belief with conviction.]**

---

### Slide 65: Teaching - What Interview Positioning Looks Like
"Interview positioning means:

Instead of walking into an interview and hoping you say the right thing...

You research what they're hiring for and prepare examples that position you as the solution.

Instead of talking about your generic experience...

You translate your experience into THEIR language and THEIR problems.

Instead of being one of many candidates...

You position yourself as THE obvious choice."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three-column comparison. "Generic Approach" vs. "Positioned Approach" vs. "Result". Show the strategic differences and outcomes.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make interview positioning tangible. Show them WHAT it looks like in practice.]**

---

### Slide 66: Teaching - How to Position Your Existing Skills
"Here's the secret:

You don't need NEW skills to get $300K+ roles.

You need to REPOSITION your existing skills.

For example:

If you've been selling to mid-market companies, you have skills that translate to enterprise.

If you've been in inside sales, you have skills that translate to field sales.

If you've been in one industry, your skills translate to other industries.

**It's not about HAVING more. It's about POSITIONING what you have correctly.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Skills translation matrix. Left column: "Your Current Skills". Right column: "How They Position for $300K+ Roles". Translation arrows showing the reframing.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the tactical teaching moment. Show them their existing skills ARE enough—they just need repositioning.]**

---

### Slide 67: Teaching - The Preparation Framework
"So how do you position yourself for interviews?

It's simple. There are three steps:

**1. Research what THEY need** - Understand their problems, their goals, their hiring criteria

**2. Map YOUR experience to THEIR needs** - Find examples from your background that solve their problems

**3. Practice positioning your answers** - Rehearse how you'll talk about your experience in their language

That's it. Research. Map. Practice.

Do this, and you'll walk into interviews positioned to win."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three-step framework visual. Step 1: Research (magnifying glass). Step 2: Map (connecting lines). Step 3: Practice (rehearsal). "Interview Positioning System" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Give them a simple, repeatable framework. Positioning sounds complex—show them it's systematic and learnable.]**

---

### Slide 68: Proof - Simon's Story (Introduction)
"Don't just take my word for it.

Let me tell you about Simon."

**[Visual Suggestion: Profile visual. "Simon" name. Starting situation preview: "$90K, Telesales". Question: "Can positioning work for him?".]**

**[Delivery Note: Transition to social proof. Your story proves it works for you. Now show it works for others.]**

---

### Slide 69: Proof - Simon's Before State
"Simon was making $90,000 a year as an Account Executive in a telesales role.

Good job. But the pay wasn't enough to meet his family's needs.

He felt stuck. He'd been applying to higher-paying roles but kept getting rejected."

**[Visual Suggestion: Simon's before state. Telesales role. $90K income. Application rejections piling up. "STUCK" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Paint the before state. Make the audience see themselves in Simon's situation.]**

---

### Slide 70: Proof - Simon's Limiting Belief
"Simon thought: 'I'm in telesales. Nobody's going to hire me for a $280K enterprise role. I don't have the right experience.'

Sound familiar?

That's the 'I'm not qualified' belief.

And it's what keeps people stuck in $90K roles when they could be making $300K."

**[Visual Suggestion: Simon's thought bubble: "I'm not qualified for enterprise roles". "LIMITING BELIEF" label. This belief keeping him at "$90K" level while "$280K roles" are above an imagined barrier.]**

**[Delivery Note: Call out the limiting belief explicitly. This is what Secret #2 destroys.]**

---

### Slide 71: Proof - Simon Learns Positioning
"So I taught Simon the same framework I'd learned:

How to identify which skills translate from telesales to enterprise.

How to research what enterprise companies need.

How to position his experience as a solution to their problems.

How to prepare for interviews so he'd walk in positioned to win."

**[Visual Suggestion: Teaching moment visual. Framework being transferred. "Skills Translation" + "Interview Positioning" components shown.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that you TAUGHT Simon the system. Positioning is transferable and teachable.]**

---

### Slide 72: Proof - Simon's Result
"Within weeks of implementing the positioning strategies, Simon had interviews lined up.

And he landed a job offer for $280,000.

That's a $190,000 raise.

Over 3x his previous income.

**Same person. Same core skills. Better positioning.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Simon's transformation. Before: $90K, telesales. After: $280K, enterprise. "3x Income" highlighted. "BETTER POSITIONING, NOT BETTER SKILLS" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Hammer home the result. 3x income. Emphasize "same core skills" to reinforce that positioning, not new skills, was the difference.]**

---

### Slide 73: Proof - The Pattern
"Do you see the pattern?

I went from $130K to $514K with the same skills. Better positioning.

Simon went from $90K to $280K with the same skills. Better positioning.

**This isn't luck. This isn't about being special. This is about mastering strategic positioning.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Pattern visual showing multiple case studies. Your transformation + Simon's transformation. All labeled "SAME SKILLS, BETTER POSITIONING". Pattern recognition emphasis.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the repeatable pattern. This proves it's a system, not an anomaly.]**

---

### Slide 74: Secret #2 Summary - The Internal Belief
"So here's what I want you to take away from Secret #2:

You ARE qualified for $300K+ roles.

You don't need an MBA. You don't need more experience. You don't need connections.

**You just need to position what you already have correctly.**

Positioning is a skill. And skills can be learned.

If I could learn it, if Simon could learn it, you can learn it too."

**[Visual Suggestion: Key takeaway box. "Secret #2: You're Qualified. Just Mis-Positioned." Reinforcement: "Positioning = Learnable Skill". Empowerment messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Summarize Secret #2. Lock in the belief that they CAN do this. Remove the "I'm not qualified" objection completely.]**

---

### Slide 75: Transition to Secret #3
"Now, I know what you're thinking:

'Okay Terrance, I get it. Positioning beats performance. I'm already qualified.

But I have a full-time job. I have a family. I don't have time to research companies and position myself for hours every day.

And I can't afford to quit my job to search full-time.

This sounds great, but is it realistic for MY situation?'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Thought bubbles showing objections: "No time", "Full-time job", "Family responsibilities", "Can't quit", "Too busy".]**

**[Delivery Note: Voice the external objections. Time, money, circumstances. Secret #3 will destroy these external beliefs.]**

---

## SECRET #3: EXTERNAL BELIEFS (Slides 76-100)
### **"The 30-Minutes-Per-Day Positioning System That Works While You're Employed"**

**Purpose:** Break the FALSE BELIEF that "I don't have time/money/circumstances to do this"
**Replace With:** TRUE BELIEF that "This system works with 30 minutes per day while I'm still employed"

---

### Slide 76: Secret #3 Title Card
**SECRET #3**

**"The 30-Minutes-Per-Day System That Gets Results in Weeks, Not Years"**

**[Visual Suggestion: "Secret #3" header. Subhead: "Why You Don't Need More Time—You Need Better Strategy". Clean, bold design.]**

**[Delivery Note: Pause. Reset energy again. This final secret removes all remaining obstacles.]**

---

## EPIPHANY BRIDGE #3: The Access Strategy (Aha Moment #2)

### Slide 77: Setting Up the Story
"Let me take you back to 2021.

I'd just had my epiphany about positioning.

I knew WHERE I wanted to be: companies like Google, Amazon, Salesforce.

I knew WHAT I needed to do: position myself so they'd recruit me.

But I had a problem..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline positioning. "2021: The Epiphany" shown. Three target companies displayed. "BUT..." leading to next slide.]**

**[Delivery Note: Set up the tension. Knowledge without execution is useless. What was the obstacle?]**

---

### Slide 78: The Obstacle
"I was still working full-time at AT&T.

60-hour weeks. Quota to hit. Customers to manage.

I had a wife and a young daughter.

I didn't have 8 hours a day to job search.

I couldn't quit my job and search full-time.

**I needed a way to do this while still employed. With limited time. Without burning out.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Busy schedule visual. Work calendar packed. Family time blocked. "60hr/week job" + "Family" + "Limited time". "HOW DO I FIT THIS IN?" question.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make this relatable. Most of your audience is in this exact situation. They're employed, busy, and can't dedicate full days to job searching.]**

---

### Slide 79: The Research Problem
"And there was another problem:

When I started researching how to get into top companies, everything I found said:

'You need connections at Google.'
'You need referrals to get past the ATS.'
'You need to network for months to build relationships.'

I didn't have months. I didn't have connections.

**I needed a way to get results FAST.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Advice snippets appearing on screen, all requiring long timelines or connections. "Months of networking", "Build relationships", "You need connections". Text: "I DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME".]**

**[Delivery Note: Voice the frustration. The traditional advice is to "network" and "build relationships" over time. But what if you don't have time?]**

---

### Slide 80: The Question
"So I asked myself:

What if I could create a systematic process that worked in 30 minutes per day?

What if I could get in front of hiring managers at Google, Amazon, and Salesforce WITHOUT having connections there?

What if I could do this while still employed, without anyone at AT&T knowing I was looking?

**Was that even possible?**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Big question framed: "30 Minutes Per Day" + "No Connections" + "While Employed" = "POSSIBLE?" Question mark visual.]**

**[Delivery Note: Frame the challenge. This sounds impossible. But that's what makes the breakthrough so powerful.]**

---

### Slide 81: The Insight - The Mindshare Problem
"That's when I had another epiphany:

The reason 2,000 people apply to Google and only 20 get interviewed isn't just about qualifications.

**It's about mindshare.**

Most candidates are never considered not because they CAN'T do the role...

But because they have ZERO mindshare with the person actually making the hiring decision."

**[Visual Suggestion: Hiring manager's mind visual. 20 candidates who have mindshare (visible in their mental space). 2,000 other applicants (invisible, outside their awareness). "Mindshare = Visibility" concept.]**

**[Delivery Note: Introduce the mindshare concept. This is the insight that unlocks the solution. You don't need to be the BEST candidate—you need to be TOP OF MIND.]**

---

### Slide 82: The Strategy
"So I thought:

What if I could gain mindshare with hiring managers at my target companies?

What if I could position myself so that when they have an opening, they think of ME?

What if I could do this systematically, predictably, in 30 minutes per day?

That's when I created what I now call the **Reverse Attraction Strategy.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Lightbulb moment. "Reverse Attraction Strategy" title card. Concept visual: Instead of chasing (applicant), make them come to you (positioning). "GAIN MINDSHARE, GET RECRUITED" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: Name the strategy. "Reverse Attraction" is a pattern interrupt—it's the OPPOSITE of traditional job search. Build intrigue.]**

---

### Slide 83: The 5-Day Experiment
"I created a simple plan.

It took 30 minutes per day.

I did it for just FIVE days.

I targeted three companies: Google, Amazon, Salesforce.

And I tracked what happened."

**[Visual Suggestion: 5-day timeline visual. "Day 1" through "Day 5". 30 minutes per day. Three target companies. "THE EXPERIMENT" label. Scientific test feel.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize the time commitment: 30 minutes per day for 5 days. That's 2.5 hours total. Make it feel achievable.]**

---

### Slide 84: The Result
"By the end of those five days...

I had interviews scheduled at Google, Amazon, AND Salesforce.

Not just one interview. Three interviews. At the three best companies in tech sales.

**One week. 30 minutes per day. Zero connections. All three companies pursuing me.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Calendar showing 5 days of execution leading to "Week 2: THREE INTERVIEWS SCHEDULED". Three company logos with checkmarks. "30 min/day × 5 days = 3 INTERVIEWS" calculation. "SUCCESS" banner.]**

**[Delivery Note: Drop this result with impact. FIVE DAYS to get interviews at the best companies in the world. This shatters the belief that you need months of networking.]**

---

### Slide 85: The Belief Shift - Access Beats Applications
"And that's when I learned the third and final lesson:

**Access beats applications.**

You don't need to be the most qualified candidate.

You don't need months to network.

You don't need connections.

**You just need to gain mindshare with the right hiring managers. And you can do that in 30 minutes per day.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: "Secret #3 Revelation" visual. "ACCESS BEATS APPLICATIONS" in large text. Comparison: "Traditional Application" (months, low odds) vs. "Reverse Attraction" (days, high odds). Visual emphasis on speed and effectiveness.]**

**[Delivery Note: State the belief shift clearly. This is the third and final domino. Access is the shortcut they've been missing.]**

---

### Slide 86: Teaching - The Reverse Attraction Strategy
"So what IS the Reverse Attraction Strategy?

It's simple:

Instead of applying to jobs and hoping someone sees your resume...

You gain mindshare with hiring managers BEFORE they post the job.

Instead of competing with 2,000 applicants...

You position yourself so hiring managers reach out to YOU when openings happen.

Instead of chasing opportunities...

**You create a system where opportunities chase you.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Traditional vs. Reverse Attraction comparison. Traditional: You → Company (application). Reverse: Company → You (recruitment). Arrows showing reversed direction. "FLIP THE SCRIPT" messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Explain the concept clearly. Reverse Attraction = hiring managers pursue you, not the other way around.]**

---

### Slide 87: Teaching - Why This Works
"Here's why this strategy works:

Hiring managers at top companies have a problem:

They need great salespeople, but most of the applicants they see aren't qualified.

They're drowning in unqualified applications while struggling to find great talent.

**When you position yourself strategically, you're solving THEIR problem.**

You become visible. You demonstrate value. You gain mindshare.

And when they have an opening, they think of YOU first."

**[Visual Suggestion: Hiring manager's problem visual. "Drowning in applications" (unqualified pile). "Searching for great talent" (empty position). Then: "You appear positioned correctly" (solution). Relief and interest shown.]**

**[Delivery Note: Reframe from the hiring manager's perspective. You're not begging for a job—you're solving their talent problem. This is a mindset shift.]**

---

### Slide 88: Teaching - The 30-Minute-Per-Day System
"So how do you do this in 30 minutes per day?

The system I created has five steps:

**P.R.I.N.T.**

**P** - Profile Matching: Identify which companies/roles are your 'better boats'
**R** - Reverse Attraction: Gain mindshare with hiring managers
**I** - Interview Mastery: Position yourself to win interviews
**N** - Negotiating the Offer: Use leverage to maximize comp
**T** - Tell Your Story: Position your brand consistently

This is the system that took me from $130K to $514K.

This is the system Simon used to go from $90K to $280K.

And this is the system I'm going to teach you today."

**[Visual Suggestion: P.R.I.N.T acronym visual. Each letter with its meaning displayed. "30 Minutes Per Day" reinforcement. "The System That Creates $75K-$125K Raises" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: Introduce the P.R.I.N.T methodology as the tactical system that executes the positioning strategy. Frame it as the "how" behind everything you've taught. NOTE: Updated tagline to match the bold promise income range.]**

---

### Slide 89: Teaching - Why 30 Minutes Per Day Works
"Why 30 minutes per day?

Because positioning isn't about VOLUME. It's about STRATEGY.

You don't need to send 100 applications.

You need to identify 5-10 target companies and position yourself strategically with each one.

You don't need 8-hour days.

You need 30 focused minutes doing the RIGHT activities.

**Quality over quantity. Strategy over effort.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Comparison visual. "Traditional Approach" (8 hours, 100 applications, scattered effort, low results). "P.R.I.N.T System" (30 minutes, 5 targets, focused strategy, high results). Efficiency emphasized.]**

**[Delivery Note: Address the time objection directly. 30 minutes is achievable. Make them believe they have time to do this.]**

---

### Slide 90: Teaching - Works While Employed
"And here's the best part:

You can do this while you're still employed.

Nobody at your current company needs to know.

You're not sending out hundreds of applications that can be traced back to you.

You're strategically positioning yourself with a handful of target companies.

30 minutes per day. Before work. During lunch. After the kids go to bed.

**You stay employed with income and benefits while positioning yourself for your next $75K-$125K raise.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Daily schedule visual. "Before Work: 30 min" or "Lunch Break: 30 min" or "After Kids Sleep: 30 min". Current job security maintained. "WORKS WHILE EMPLOYED" emphasized.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove the risk objection. They don't have to quit. They don't have to take financial risk. This is safe and systematic. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise income range.]**

---

### Slide 91: Proof - Darrell's Story (Introduction)
"Let me tell you about Darrell.

Darrell was in the EXACT situation many of you are in right now."

**[Visual Suggestion: Profile visual. "Darrell" name. Starting situation: "AT&T, $100K, Felt Stuck". "Sound Familiar?" question.]**

**[Delivery Note: Introduce Darrell as relatable social proof. He was where they are.]**

---

### Slide 92: Proof - Darrell's Before State
"Darrell was at AT&T making $100,000 as an Account Manager.

He felt stuck. Underpaid. But he didn't see a path out.

He had a full-time job. He had bills. He couldn't just quit and search full-time.

Sound familiar?"

**[Visual Suggestion: Darrell's before state. AT&T, $100K, "STUCK" feeling. Full schedule. Bills and responsibilities shown. "No Time to Search" constraint.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make Darrell's situation mirror the audience's situation. Create identification.]**

---

### Slide 93: Proof - Darrell Learns the System
"So I taught Darrell the P.R.I.N.T system.

He identified his target companies.

He implemented the Reverse Attraction strategy—30 minutes per day.

He prepared for interviews using the positioning framework.

All while still working full-time at AT&T."

**[Visual Suggestion: Darrell implementing the system. 30 minutes per day shown. Still employed at AT&T (job security maintained). System execution in progress.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that Darrell did this WHILE employed. Same constraints as the audience.]**

---

### Slide 94: Proof - Darrell's First Result
"Within weeks, Darrell had interviews lined up.

He landed an offer for $90,000 more than he was making.

$100K to $190K.

**30 minutes per day. Still employed. First major raise.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Darrell's first transformation. $100K → $190K. "+$90K RAISE" highlighted. "FIRST SUCCESS" label. Timeline showing "Weeks, Not Years".]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize the timeline (weeks) and the method (30 min/day while employed). This proves Secret #3.]**

---

### Slide 95: Proof - Darrell's Repeat Success
"But here's what's even better:

A year later, Darrell used the SAME EXACT METHOD to get another raise.

Another $80,000 increase plus a $70,000 stock bonus.

Because once you master positioning, you can use it again and again.

**Darrell went from $100K to $340K in two years using this system.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Darrell's progression timeline. Year 1: $100K → $190K. Year 2: $190K → $340K+. Total transformation: "$100K → $340K in 2 Years". "POSITIONING = CAREER-LONG SKILL" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that positioning is not a one-time trick. It's a repeatable skill. This increases the value of what you're teaching.]**

---

### Slide 96: Proof - The Pattern Across All Stories
"Look at the pattern:

I used this system: $130K → $514K. While employed.

Simon used this system: $90K → $280K. While employed.

Darrell used this system: $100K → $340K. While employed. Twice.

**Same system. Same time commitment. 30 minutes per day. Multiple people. Repeatable results.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Three case studies side by side. Your transformation + Simon's + Darrell's. All showing "30 Min/Day" + "While Employed" + "$75K-$125K Raises". "PROVEN SYSTEM" label.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the pattern across all three stories. This is social proof that the system works for different people in different situations. NOTE: Visual updated to emphasize the bold promise income range.]**

---

### Slide 97: Proof - Why This System Gets Fast Results
"Why does this system work so fast?

Because you're not competing with 2,000 applicants.

You're gaining mindshare with hiring managers before the job is even posted.

You're positioning yourself as a solution to their problem.

You're becoming a CANDIDATE they recruit, not an APPLICANT they filter.

**That's why you can get results in weeks instead of months or years.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two timelines compared. "Traditional Job Search" (6-12 months, scattered applications, low odds). "P.R.I.N.T System" (Weeks, targeted positioning, high conversion). Speed difference emphasized.]**

**[Delivery Note: Explain WHY it's fast. Speed isn't just nice—it's proof that the strategy is superior.]**

---

### Slide 98: Secret #3 Summary - The External Belief
"So here's what I want you to take away from Secret #3:

You DON'T need months to network.

You DON'T need to quit your job to search full-time.

You DON'T need 8 hours a day.

**You need 30 minutes per day. You need the right system. And you need to position yourself strategically.**

Do that, and you can increase your annual income by $75K-$125K in 90 days or less.

While still employed. With limited time. Using a proven, repeatable system."

**[Visual Suggestion: Key takeaway box. "Secret #3: Access Beats Applications". Reinforcement: "30 Min/Day × 90 Days = $75K-$125K Income Increase". Objections crossed out: "No time ✗", "Need to quit ✗", "Takes months ✗". Truth highlighted: "Works While Employed ✓".]**

**[Delivery Note: Summarize Secret #3. Remove ALL external objections. They have time. They don't need to quit. This IS realistic for their situation. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise income range.]**

---

### Slide 99: Transition to Stack
"So now you know the three secrets:

**Secret #1:** Positioning beats performance. Your income is determined by your market positioning.

**Secret #2:** You're already qualified. You just need to position what you have correctly.

**Secret #3:** You can do this in 30 minutes per day while still employed using the P.R.I.N.T system.

**Once you accept these three beliefs, increasing your income by $75K-$125K becomes inevitable.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Three secrets recap visual. Each secret shown with its core belief. "Three Dominoes = Everything Else Falls Into Place" messaging. "NOW WHAT?" leading to next section.]**

**[Delivery Note: Recap all three secrets. Show how they build on each other. Create logical inevitability: if all three are true, then the offer you're about to make is the obvious next step. NOTE: Updated closing statement to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 100: Pre-Stack Transition
"So the question now isn't WHETHER this works.

The question is: How do you actually DO this?

How do you implement the P.R.I.N.T system?

How do you position yourself to increase your income by $75K-$125K in 90 days or less?

That's what I want to show you next..."

**[Delivery Note: Create desire for the "how." They believe it works. Now they want to know how to access it. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

## TIER 1 FUTURE PACING: Pre-Stack Vision (Slides 101-104)

### Slide 101: "One Year from Now"
"Before I show you how this works, let me paint you a picture of where you'll be one year from today if you commit to mastering strategic positioning.

One year from now, you're not at the same company making the same money feeling the same frustration.

You're at a company that values you. You're making $75,000-$125,000 more per year.

But here's what nobody tells you about that raise—it's not just about the money.

It's about having positioned yourself in a market where that income is NORMAL, not exceptional."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline graphic showing "Today" vs "1 Year from Now". Side-by-side comparison imagery. Dollar amount prominently displayed but NOT the only focus. "Better Position = Better Normal" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the bridge from teaching to offer. Slow down. Make them feel the one-year transformation before you pitch anything. NOTE: Updated income range to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 102: "The Life Change"
"It's Friday at 4:45 PM.

Your coworkers are still online—they'll be grinding until 7 PM.

But you're shutting down your laptop.

Because at this company, they don't measure your value by how many hours you work. They measure your value by the results you drive.

You actually GET to have dinner with your family. On a weekday.

You're not stressed. You're not burned out. You're not wondering if there's something better out there.

Because you KNOW you're in the right place."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split scene. Left: Clock showing 4:45 PM, closed laptop, dinner table with family. Right: Other workers still at desk, stressed, late hours.]**

**[Delivery Note: This addresses the emotional "why" behind career change. Paint the lifestyle picture. Many attendees are burned out—this speaks to that pain.]**

---

### Slide 103: "The Confidence - Positioning Mastery"
"But here's the best part:

You're not worried about job security anymore.

Because you now have a skill that nobody can take away from you.

You know how to position yourself strategically. You know how to get recruited. You know how to interview. You know how to negotiate.

If you ever wanted to leave, you could have three offers in 60 days.

That confidence—that knowing you're ALWAYS in control of your career—changes everything.

**That's what mastering positioning gives you. That's the real value.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Confident person standing tall. Icons representing the skills: positioning, recruiting, interviewing, negotiating. "Always in Control" messaging. "Positioning Mastery = Career Control" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the meta-skill positioning. They're not just buying a job search—they're buying positioning mastery forever. Emphasize "mastering positioning" to reinforce the skill acquisition.]**

---

### Slide 104: "The Decision"
"So the question is:

Do you want to still be where you are now, one year from today?

Or do you want to be THERE—in that life, with that income, with that confidence?

If the answer is the second one, here's what we've created..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Fork in the road visual. Path 1: "Stay the Same" (dark, uninspiring). Path 2: "Master Positioning & Transform" (bright, aspirational). Arrow pointing to Path 2.]**

**[Delivery Note: Binary choice. Make staying the same feel painful. Make transformation feel achievable. Then transition naturally to the stack/offer.]**

---

## SECTION: THE STACK & OFFER (Slides 105-154)

### Slide 105: Stack Introduction
"We've taken everything I've learned—everything that took me from $130K to over $1M in compensation...

Everything Simon used to 3x his income...

Everything Darrell used to get $170K in raises...

And we've packaged it into a complete system called **The Active Offer System**."

**[Visual Suggestion: "THE ACTIVE OFFER SYSTEM" title card. Professional branding. "Complete Positioning Mastery Program" subtitle.]**

**[Delivery Note: Name the program. Position it as the complete systemization of everything you've taught.]**

---

### Slide 106: Stack - What You're Getting
"Here's what's included when you join The Active Offer System..."

**[Visual Suggestion: "What's Included" header. Stack visual beginning to build (literally stacking items visually as you go through components).]**

**[Delivery Note: Begin the stack presentation. Each component will be added visually, creating the "overwhelming value" perception.]**

---

### Slide 107: Component #1 - Profile Matching
"**Component #1: Profile Matching**

This is where we help you identify which companies are your 'better boats.'

Not random companies. Not spray-and-pray.

We use our network, industry insights, and market data to identify the 5-10 companies that will pay you $300K+ for your specific skillset.

If you tried to research this yourself, it would take months and you'd likely target the wrong companies.

We do this for you in week one.

**Value if purchased separately: $5,000**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #1 added to stack. "Profile Matching" visual with target companies icon. "$5,000 Value" displayed. Stack growing.]**

**[Delivery Note: Explain WHAT it is, WHY it matters, and what the VALUE is. Follow this pattern for each component.]**

---

### Slide 108: Component #2 - Reverse Attraction System
"**Component #2: The Reverse Attraction System**

This is the exact 30-minutes-per-day system I used to get interviews at Google, Amazon, and Salesforce in one week.

You'll get:
- The exact scripts that land interviews
- The messaging templates that gain mindshare with hiring managers
- The step-by-step process to implement while still employed

This is the system that creates the "companies recruiting you" transformation.

**Value if purchased separately: $7,500**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #2 added to stack. "Reverse Attraction System" with messaging/script icons. "$7,500 Value" displayed. Stack growing visibly.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize that this is the EXACT system. They're getting your proven playbook.]**

---

### Slide 109: Component #3 - Interview Mastery Training
"**Component #3: Interview Mastery Training**

Remember my story about bombing the first Salesforce interview and then crushing the second?

This is how I did it.

You'll get:
- The exact interview preparation framework
- Company-specific interview assets (30-60-90 day plans, presentation templates)
- The questions top companies ask and how to position your answers
- Real interview examples from Google, Amazon, Salesforce, and more

This is what transforms you from someone who GETS interviews to someone who WINS them.

**Value if purchased separately: $8,000**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #3 added to stack. "Interview Mastery" with presentation/preparation icons. "$8,000 Value" displayed. Stack growing dramatically now.]**

**[Delivery Note: Tie this back to your epiphany bridge story. This component solves the problem you had.]**

---

### Slide 110: Component #4 - Negotiation Mastery
"**Component #4: Negotiation Mastery**

This is how Darrell got a $90K raise on his first offer.

This is how Simon negotiated from $90K to $280K.

You'll learn:
- How to create leverage using multiple offers
- The exact negotiation frameworks that get $75K-$125K raises
- What to say, when to say it, and how to position your value
- Real compensation negotiation support when you get your offers

Most people leave $50K-$100K on the table because they don't know how to negotiate from a position of strength.

This component alone could be worth 10x your investment.

**Value if purchased separately: $10,000**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #4 added to stack. "Negotiation Mastery" with leverage/money icons. "$10,000 Value" displayed. Stack is getting very tall visually.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize ROI. This component could literally pay for the entire program 10x over with ONE negotiation. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise income range.]**

---

### Slide 111: Component #5 - Group Coaching (Twice Weekly)
"**Component #5: Live Group Coaching Calls (Twice Per Week)**

You'll have access to me and our team twice per week for live coaching.

Bring your questions. Get feedback on your positioning. Workshop your interview prep. Get real-time support.

This isn't pre-recorded content you watch alone.

This is live, ongoing support as you implement the system.

**Value for 90 days if purchased separately: $12,000**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #5 added to stack. "Live Coaching" with video call icons. "2x Per Week" emphasized. "$12,000 Value" displayed. Stack continues growing.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize the ongoing support. This isn't "buy and goodbye"—it's accountability and support.]**

---

### Slide 112: Component #6 - Private Community
"**Component #6: Private Community Access**

You'll join a community of ambitious sales professionals all mastering positioning together.

Network with people who are going through the same transformation.

Get referrals. Share wins. Learn from each other's experiences.

Many of our members have connected and referred each other into roles at top companies.

**Value if purchased separately: $3,000**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #6 added to stack. "Private Community" with networking/people icons. "$3,000 Value" displayed.]**

**[Delivery Note: Community value is about network effects and peer support. Position this as ongoing career network.]**

---

### Slide 113: Component #7 - Complete Resource Library
"**Component #7: Complete Resource Library**

You'll get every template, script, and asset we've ever created:

- Resume templates optimized for ATS and tech sales
- LinkedIn profile audit checklist and optimization templates
- Cold email and LinkedIn message vault (200+ tested messages)
- Interview question database for top companies (Google, Amazon, Salesforce, etc.)
- 30-60-90 day plan templates
- Presentation templates for interviews
- Self-accountability tracking system

Everything you need to implement the P.R.I.N.T system.

**Value if purchased separately: $5,000**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Component #7 added to stack. "Resource Library" with template/document icons. "$5,000 Value" displayed. Stack is very tall now.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the "implementation toolkit." Everything they need to execute is included.]**

---

### Slide 114: Total Value Calculation
"So let's add this up:

Profile Matching: $5,000
Reverse Attraction System: $7,500
Interview Mastery Training: $8,000
Negotiation Mastery: $10,000
Live Group Coaching (90 days): $12,000
Private Community Access: $3,000
Complete Resource Library: $5,000

**Total value if purchased separately: $50,500**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Calculator visual showing all components adding up. Each component's value shown. Final total: "$50,500 TOTAL VALUE" in large text. Full stack shown visually.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the math clearly. Let the $50,500 number sink in. This creates the anchor for your actual price.]**

---

### Slide 115: The Investment
"Now, if I wanted to, I could charge $50,000 for this program.

And honestly? If it increases your income by just $100K, you'd make your money back in the first year.

But I'm not going to charge you $50,000.

I'm not even going to charge you $25,000.

**Your investment to join The Active Offer System is $5,000.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Price reveal. "$50,500 Value" crossed out. "$25,000" crossed out. Final price "$5,000" revealed and highlighted. "90% Discount" or "10x Value" messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Pause before revealing $5,000. Let the contrast between $50,500 value and $5,000 investment create the "wow" factor.]**

---

### Slide 116: Payment Plan Option
"And if $5,000 all at once feels like too much, we have payment plans available.

You can split it into monthly payments.

**That's less than $200 per week to master the skill that will control your income for the rest of your career.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Payment plan visual. "$5,000" OR "6 payments of $917" OR "12 payments of $475". "Less Than $200/Week" calculation shown. "Flexible Options" messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Reduce price resistance by breaking it down to weekly cost. $200/week for career transformation sounds very reasonable.]**

---

### Slide 117: ROI Framing
"Let's talk about ROI for a second:

If you're making $150K now, and this gets you a $100K raise (within the $75K-$125K range our students achieve), that's $250K total compensation.

Over the next 5 years, that's $500,000 in additional income.

Over your career? $2-3 million more.

Your investment today is $5,000.

That's a 20x return in year one. 100x return over five years.

**This isn't an expense. This is the highest-ROI investment you'll ever make.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: ROI calculation visual. Year 1: "$100K raise" vs. "$5K investment" = "20x ROI". 5 Years: "$500K additional income". Career: "$2-3M more". ROI emphasized heavily.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make the math undeniable. $5K investment for $2-3M return over career. Frame this as investing in themselves, not spending money. NOTE: Updated to reference the bold promise income range.]**

---

### Slide 118: Cost of Inaction
"Now let's look at the cost of doing NOTHING:

If you stay at $150K for the next 5 years while your peers who master positioning move to $250K+ roles (a $100K increase within our typical $75K-$125K range)...

You've lost $500,000.

Not making a decision IS a decision.

**The question isn't 'Can I afford this?' The question is 'Can I afford NOT to do this?'**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Cost of inaction calculation. "Stay at $150K" vs. "Peers at $250K+" = "$500K Lost Over 5 Years". Painful visual of opportunity cost. "Doing Nothing Has a Price" text.]**

**[Delivery Note: Create urgency through opportunity cost. Staying where they are is expensive. This reframes the investment as preventing massive loss. NOTE: Updated to be more conservative and aligned with bold promise range.]**

---

### Slide 119: Guarantee (Risk Reversal)
"And here's the thing:

You're not taking any risk.

If you join The Active Offer System, implement the strategies, show up to the coaching calls, and don't see results...

I'll personally work with you until you do.

**You're either increasing your income by $75K-$125K, or you're getting more support until you are.**

That's my commitment to you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Guarantee badge. "Results or Continued Support" promise. Risk-free messaging. "I'm Invested in Your Success" personal commitment framing.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove the risk. Position this as "you can't lose"—either you get results or you get more support. This is a partnership, not a transaction. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 120: Who This Is For (Qualification)
"Now, let me be clear about who this program is for:

This is for experienced sales professionals who are currently making $80K+ and want to increase their income by $75K-$125K by positioning themselves for $250K-$400K+ roles at top companies.

This is for people who have at least 4 years of sales experience and are in B2B sales.

This is for people who are willing to invest 30 minutes per day for 90 days to transform their career.

**This is for people who are ready to stop working harder and start positioning smarter.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Qualification checklist. "THIS IS FOR YOU IF:" followed by criteria. Each criterion with checkmark. "Ready to Transform" messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Qualify them. This makes the offer feel selective, which increases desire and ensures you're working with the right people. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise framing.]**

---

### Slide 121: Who This Is NOT For (Disqualification)
"This is NOT for people just starting in sales.

This is NOT for people making under $80K who don't have the experience to position for $250K-$400K+ roles yet.

This is NOT for people who want a magic button that requires no work.

This is NOT for people who aren't willing to invest 30 minutes per day.

**If that's you, this program isn't the right fit right now.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Disqualification list. "THIS IS NOT FOR YOU IF:" followed by disqualifiers. Each with X mark. "And That's Okay" messaging to maintain goodwill.]**

**[Delivery Note: Disqualify explicitly. This increases desire among qualified prospects ("I AM qualified") and prevents unqualified leads from wasting your time. NOTE: Updated role range to be consistent with bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 122: The Application Process
"So here's how this works:

This isn't a 'buy now' button.

Because I only want to work with people who are the right fit, and I want to make sure YOU feel good about this decision too.

So the next step is to book a free strategy call.

On that call, we're going to:
- Map out your ideal role (compensation, company, lifestyle)
- Identify the positioning gaps keeping you stuck
- Show you the roadmap to your $75K-$125K income increase
- Determine if The Active Offer System is the right fit

**If it's a great fit for both of us, we'll invite you to join. If not, you'll still walk away with a clear action plan.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Application process visual. Step 1: "Book Free Call". Step 2: "Strategy Session". Step 3: "Mutual Decision". Step 4: "Join Program (If Right Fit)". Clean, professional process flow.]**

**[Delivery Note: Position the call as qualification, not sales. This is a two-way evaluation. This increases perceived value and reduces sales resistance. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 123: What Happens on the Call
"The strategy call is simple:

We'll spend 45 minutes mapping out your situation.

You'll tell me where you are, where you want to be, and what's been holding you back.

I'll show you exactly how someone in your situation can use strategic positioning to increase their income by $75K-$125K.

You'll walk away with clarity on your next steps—whether you join The Active Offer System or not.

**No pressure. No manipulation. Just clarity on how positioning can transform your career.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Strategy call visual. "45-Minute Session" shown. What we'll cover listed. "Clarity Guaranteed" messaging. "No Pressure, Just Strategy" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove fear of "sales call." Position this as strategy session where they get value regardless of whether they join. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 124: Urgency - Limited Availability
"Now, I need to be transparent with you:

I can only work with a limited number of people at a time.

Between the live coaching calls twice per week and the personal support we provide, I can only take on 15 new members per month.

**That means there are only a limited number of strategy call slots available.**

If you're serious about increasing your income by $75K-$125K in the next 90 days, you need to book your call today.

Spots fill up quickly, and if you wait, you might have to wait until next month."

**[Visual Suggestion: Scarcity visual. "15 Spots Available This Month" with countdown or limited slots imagery. "Book Your Call Today" urgency messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Create genuine urgency. If you truly are limiting enrollment (which you should for quality), communicate that clearly. This overcomes procrastination. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 125: Urgency - Cost of Delay
"And here's the other thing to consider:

Every month you wait is another month at your current income.

If you could be earning $10K more per month (a $120K annual increase, which is within our typical $75K-$125K range)...

That's $10,000 per month you're leaving on the table.

Waiting 3 months to decide costs you $30,000.

Waiting a year costs you $120,000.

**How much is procrastination costing you?**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Cost of delay calculation. "Every Month You Wait = $10K Lost". "3 Months = $30K Lost". "1 Year = $120K Lost". Painful visual of opportunity cost mounting.]**

**[Delivery Note: Make delay painful. They're losing money every month they stay where they are. This creates "I need to act NOW" urgency. NOTE: Updated to be conservative and aligned with bold promise range.]**

---

### Slide 126: Final Future Pacing - 45 Days After the Call
"And 45 days after that call—if you decide to join us—you'll be sitting in your first interview with a company that's excited to meet you.

Not because you applied online and got lucky.

Because you positioned yourself strategically and they recruited you.

That's when you'll know this was the right decision.

**That's when you'll see the Positioning Principle working in your life.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Calendar showing "Day 1: Strategy Call" → "Day 45: First Interview". Interview scene with confident candidate and engaged interviewer. Checkmark: "They Recruited YOU." "Positioning in Action" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: Future pace beyond the call to the first tangible result. 45 days is specific and believable. Make them visualize success.]**

---

### Slide 127: Social Proof Reminder
"Remember:

I did this. $130K to $514K.

Simon did this. $90K to $280K.

Darrell did this. $100K to $340K. Twice.

**This system works. The only question is: Will you be next?**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Three success stories displayed side by side. "PROVEN RESULTS" header. "Will You Be Next?" question with confidence-building messaging.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remind them of the proof one more time. Social proof right before the CTA increases conversion.]**

---

### Slide 128: The Choice
"So you have a choice to make right now:

**Choice #1:** Close this webinar. Go back to your current situation. Keep doing what you've been doing. And hope things change on their own.

**Choice #2:** Book a free strategy call. Get clarity on how positioning can increase your income by $75K-$125K. And if it's the right fit, join The Active Offer System and master the skill that will control your income for the rest of your life.

**Which choice are you going to make?**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two paths diverging. Path 1: "Stay the Same" (dark, stuck, same income in 1 year). Path 2: "Master Positioning" (bright, transformed, $75K-$125K higher income in 1 year). Question: "Which Path Do You Choose?".]**

**[Delivery Note: Binary choice. Make the contrast stark. Path 1 is painful. Path 2 is transformational. Guide them to the obvious choice. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 129: The Call to Action - Part 1
"If you're ready to transform your career...

If you're ready to stop working harder and start positioning smarter...

If you're ready to increase your income by $75K-$125K instead of chasing applications that go nowhere...

**Then click the button below and book your free strategy call right now.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: CTA button appearing. "BOOK YOUR FREE STRATEGY CALL" text. Professional, prominent, clickable design. Urgency: "Limited Slots Available".]**

**[Delivery Note: Direct, clear CTA. Tell them exactly what to do next. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 130: The Call to Action - Part 2
"You'll pick a time that works for you—probably sometime in the next 7 days.

You'll hop on Zoom with me or someone from my team.

We'll map out your exact situation and show you the roadmap to your $75K-$125K income increase.

And if The Active Offer System is the right fit, we'll invite you to join.

**It starts with clicking the button below.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Process flow visual. "Click Button" → "Pick Time" → "Strategy Session" → "Get Clarity" → "Transform Career". CTA button reinforced.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove confusion. Show them exactly what happens next. Make it feel easy and safe. NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 131: Final CTA - Visual Emphasis
"CLICK THE BUTTON BELOW, BOOK YOUR FREE POSITIONING ASSESSMENT, AND LET'S INCREASE YOUR INCOME BY $75K-$125K IN THE NEXT 90 DAYS"

[Three red arrows pointing down to CTA buttons]

**[BUTTON: BOOK YOUR FREE STRATEGY CALL NOW]**

**[Visual Suggestion: Bold, impossible-to-miss CTA. Three arrows pointing down (as in original). Large button. High contrast. "Limited Availability - Book Today" urgency text below.]**

**[Delivery Note: Maximum visual emphasis. This is the final push. Speak with conviction and urgency. NOTE: Updated headline to match bold promise.]**

---

## BACKUP/REINFORCEMENT SLIDES (Slides 132-154)

**[Note: These are additional slides you can use if needed for Q&A, objection handling, or extended close]**

### Slide 132: Objection - "I don't have time"
"Objection: 'I don't have time for this right now.'

Answer: That's exactly why you NEED this system.

The P.R.I.N.T system takes 30 minutes per day. That's less time than you spend scrolling social media.

And once you master positioning, you'll save YEARS of career stagnation.

The question isn't 'Do you have time?' The question is 'Can you afford to waste more time staying where you are?'"

---

### Slide 133: Objection - "What if it doesn't work for me?"
"Objection: 'What if this doesn't work for me?'

Answer: Then you keep working with us until it does.

That's our guarantee. You're either getting results or getting more support.

Plus, this system has worked for people with different backgrounds, different industries, different starting points.

If you're an experienced B2B salesperson making $80K+, it will work for you too."

---

### Slide 134: Objection - "I need to think about it"
"Objection: 'I need to think about it.'

Answer: I get it. This is a big decision.

But here's what I want you to think about:

Every month you wait is another month at your current income. That could be $8,000+ in lost potential earnings per month.

The strategy call is free. You risk nothing by booking it and getting clarity.

Thinking about it for weeks or months costs you tens of thousands of dollars in opportunity cost.

**Book the call. Get clarity. THEN decide.**"

---

### Slide 135: Objection - "I don't have the money right now"
"Objection: 'I don't have the money right now.'

Answer: I understand. $5,000 is a real investment.

But here's the thing: if you could be earning $10,000+ more per month, you're losing that amount EVERY MONTH you stay where you are.

Three months from now, you'll have lost $30,000+ in opportunity cost—6x the investment in this program.

We have payment plans available to make this accessible.

And if you truly can't afford $5,000 right now, then you DEFINITELY can't afford to keep losing $10,000+ per month by staying in your current situation.

**This program pays for itself with ONE positioning win.**"

---

### Slide 136: FAQ - "How long until I see results?"
"Question: 'How long until I see results?'

Answer: Most students get their first interviews within 30-45 days of starting the program.

Most students land offers within 90 days.

Darrell got his first $90K raise in a matter of weeks.

Simon got his $280K offer within weeks of implementing the system.

I got interviews at Google, Amazon, and Salesforce within ONE WEEK.

**The system is designed to get you results fast—weeks, not months or years.**"

---

### Slide 137: FAQ - "What if I don't live near major tech hubs?"
"Question: 'What if I don't live in San Francisco or New York?'

Answer: It doesn't matter.

Most of the roles we position people for are remote or hybrid.

Darrell wasn't in a tech hub. Simon wasn't in a tech hub.

The companies we target (Google, Amazon, Salesforce, etc.) hire nationally and globally.

**Location is no longer a barrier. Positioning is what matters.**"

---

### Slide 138: FAQ - "What if I'm in a different industry?"
"Question: 'I'm not in software sales. Will this work for me?'

Answer: Yes, if you're in B2B sales.

The positioning principles work across industries.

We've helped people transition from telecom (like Darrell), from telesales (like Simon), from various industries into high-paying tech sales roles.

Your skills translate. You just need to position them correctly.

**That's what we teach you to do.**"

---

### Slide 139: FAQ - "Is this just for people targeting FAANG?"
"Question: 'What if I don't want to work at Google or Amazon?'

Answer: FAANG companies are examples, not requirements.

There are hundreds of companies that pay $250K-$400K+ for sales roles.

We help you identify the companies that fit YOUR goals—whether that's FAANG, high-growth startups, or established tech leaders.

The positioning principles work regardless of which specific companies you target.

**We customize the strategy to YOUR career goals, not a one-size-fits-all approach.**"

---

### Slide 140: Final Reminder - The Three Secrets
"Remember the three secrets:

**Secret #1:** Your income is determined by your positioning, not your performance. Get in the right boat.

**Secret #2:** You're already qualified. You just need to position what you have correctly.

**Secret #3:** You can do this in 30 minutes per day while still employed.

**These three beliefs, once accepted, make increasing your income by $75K-$125K inevitable.**

The Active Offer System teaches you how to implement all three."

**[NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 141: The Transformation Is Waiting
"The transformation you want is on the other side of this decision.

The $75K-$125K income increase.

The 40-hour work weeks instead of 60.

The dinner with your family instead of late nights at the office.

The financial freedom. The career control. The confidence.

**It's all waiting for you.**

But it only happens if you take action right now."

**[NOTE: Updated to match bold promise.]**

---

### Slide 142: What Are You Waiting For?
"What are you waiting for?

Permission? You have it.

The 'right time'? It's now. Every month you wait costs you $8,000-$10,000+.

More confidence? Confidence comes from action, not thinking about action.

A sign? This webinar IS the sign.

**Stop waiting. Start positioning. Book your call.**"

---

### Slide 143: The Investment in Yourself
"This isn't an expense.

## WEBINAR DELIVERY NOTES

### Pacing Guidelines
- **Introduction (with Bold Promise):** 10 minutes (engage quickly, let income promise land)
- **Secret #1:** 20 minutes (this is the foundation—don't rush)
- **Secret #2:** 15 minutes (build on Secret #1)
- **Secret #3:** 15 minutes (complete the belief framework)
- **Stack & Close:** 15 minutes (create value, handle objections, drive to CTA)
- **Total:** 75 minutes (target), 90 minutes (maximum)

### Energy Management
- Start high energy (introduction)
- **SLOW DOWN on Slide 4B** (income reveal) - this is THE moment
- Deep, storytelling energy (epiphany bridges)
- Teaching energy (framework explanations)
- Excitement/urgency energy (stack and close)

### Key Phrases to Repeat
These phrases should appear 5-7 times throughout the webinar:
1. "Positioning beats performance"
2. "Same skills, better positioning"
3. "Better boat, not better skills"
4. "30 minutes per day"
5. "While still employed"
6. "You're qualified, just mis-positioned"
7. "Access beats applications"
8. **NEW:** "$75K-$125K income increase in 90 days" (reference the promise throughout)

### Slide Transition Tips
- Use vocal pauses between secrets to reset attention
- **Slides 4A-4E: Use the progressive reveal to build anticipation - pause between each slide**
- Slow down on Big Domino moments (slides 31, 63, 85)
- Speed up on stack presentation to create momentum
- Create urgency through pacing in final CTA sequence

### Bold Promise Delivery (Slides 4A-4E) - CRITICAL
**Slide 4A:** Speak normally, building anticipation
**Slide 4B:** SLOW DOWN. Pause 2-3 seconds after saying the income range. Let it SINK IN. The visual should be HUGE numbers. This is the hero moment.
**Slide 4C:** Resume normal pace, emphasizing "90 days or less"
**Slide 4D:** Slightly faster, removing objections one by one
**Slide 4E:** Confident, reassuring tone - "proven system"

**Show to Call-Booking Rate:** Target 22-30% (improved from 18-30% baseline due to stronger promise)
