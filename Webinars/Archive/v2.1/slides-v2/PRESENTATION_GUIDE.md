## Delivery Tips

### Pacing
- **Don't rush**: 120 slides in 60-75 minutes = 30-40 seconds per slide average
- Some slides are quick (transition slides), others need 60-90 seconds (story slides)
- Pause on number/stat slides - let impact register
- Use transition slides (16, 46, 71) as brief pauses

### Engagement Points
- **Slide 15**: "Sound good? Let's dive in" - get agreement
- **Slide 45**: "Make sense?" - check understanding
- **Slide 70**: "Still with me?" - re-engage attention
- **Slide 95**: "So what's next?" - transition question
- Throughout: Ask rhetorical questions, create curiosity gaps

### Story Delivery
- **Your story (slides 22-29)**: Be authentic, vulnerable, detailed
- **Darrel (41-43)**: Focus on timeline and specific numbers
- **Jennifer (62-67)**: Emphasize the doubt-to-belief journey
- **Marcus (79-85)**: Concrete daily routine is the key

### Visual Cues
- When slide has large emphasized text - read it verbatim
- When slide has bullets - expand on each point
- When slide has numbers - pause and let them absorb
- When slide has quote - read with appropriate emotion

### Energy Management
- Start strong (slides 1-15): High energy, enthusiastic
- Middle sections: Teaching mode, authoritative but approachable
- Stories: Authentic, conversational, emotional where appropriate
- Close: Confident, invitational, creating next step
