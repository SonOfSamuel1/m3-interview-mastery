## YOUR PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION STORY

### Before State (AT&T Era)
- **Company:** AT&T
- **Duration:** 10 years (2011-2021)
- **Final Year Income (2021):** $130,000
- **Role:** Various sales roles across 10 years
- **Pain Points:**
  - Long hours
  - Feeling stuck
  - Not enough money to get out of debt
  - Unable to allow wife to stay home with daughter
  - Being overlooked for promotions and higher paying roles

### The Catalyst (2021)
- **Trigger:** Overlooked for promotion despite being top performer
- **Year:** 2021
- **Emotional Impact:** After 10 years of loyalty and high performance, still passed over

### The 4 Aha Moments (Discovery Journey)

#### Aha Moment #1: The Income Discovery (The Rabbit Hole)
**When:** Random day in the office
**What Happened:** Overheard coworkers talking about a colleague who left AT&T
**The Revelation:** Former colleague was making $400K+ at a mid-market software company
**The Question:** "How is he pulling this off? I was pretty good at what I did but barely cracked $150K in my best year."
**The Action:** Went down a rabbit hole researching top sales roles industry-wide
**The Discovery:** Average salespeople at top companies were easily making hundreds of thousands of dollars more
**The Belief Shift:** "The role you're in matters more than how hard you work"

#### Aha Moment #2: The Access Strategy (Beating the Odds)
**The Problem:** Trying to figure out how to beat the other 99% of applicants
**The Stats Realization:** At Google, 2,000 people apply, only 20 get interviewed
**The Insight:** "Getting in front of the hiring manager and gaining mindshare is half the battle. Most candidates are never considered for roles not because they can't do them, but because they have zero percent mindshare with the person actually hiring."
**The Strategy:** "If I can figure this out, I can dramatically increase my chances of landing one of these offers."
**The Result:** After implementing the first part of Active Offer strategy, landed interviews with Salesforce, Google, and Amazon within one week
**The Belief Shift:** "Access beats applications"

#### Aha Moment #3: The Interview Mastery (The Bomb → The Plan)
**The Failure:** First Salesforce interview - bombed completely
**The Realization:** "I'm terrible at interviews and the interview structure was unlike other interviews I took in the past."
**The Second Chance:** Within a week, received another interview at Salesforce for different position
**The Preparation:** "This time I was prepared with an abundance of research on what hiring managers are looking for and how to ace the interview with ease."
**The Result:** "My plan worked like a charm."
**The Insight:** "With pre-prepared interview assets and clear understandings of how these interviews differ from typical sales interviews, and understanding what they were hiring for, anyone can ace the interview with ease."
**The Belief Shift:** "Preparation beats natural talent"

#### Aha Moment #4: The Equity Strategy (The Million-Dollar Framework)
**When:** 2023
**Who:** Long-time Vice President of Sales at Salesforce
**What:** VP had made millions during his time in tech sales
**The Teaching:** His framework for how people were making over $1M in a year in tech sales through equity
**The Application:** Took his advice in 2024
**The Result:** Landed a job that not only paid high commissions, but earned over $1M in equity in 1.5 years
**The Belief Shift:** "Total compensation includes equity - that's where the real wealth is"

### The Transformation Timeline

**2012:** $65,000 income
**2021:** $130,000 income (AT&T final year)
**2022:** $514,000 (Salesforce - first full year as Account Executive)
**2024-2025:** $1.08M+ W2 compensation (not including equity)
**Total Equity Earned:** ~$1M in equity in 1.5 years

**Time from Discovery to Hired:** "Hired within 6 days" after landing interviews

**First New Role:** Account Executive at Salesforce
**First Year Income:** $400K+ (partial year), $514K full year

### Current Situation (2025)

- **Lifestyle:** Living life on own terms
- **Focus:**
  - Spending more time with family

## THE BIG DOMINO (Core Belief)

**The One Belief That Changes Everything:**

"Your income as a salesperson isn't determined by how hard you work or how good you are at selling—it's determined by WHO is hiring you, which roles you target, and how you POSITION yourself to get in front of hiring managers."

**Alternative Framings (all accurate):**
- "Positioning beats performance"
- "Access beats applications"
- "Target market determines income"
- "The boat you're in matters more than how hard you row"

**Old Way vs. New Way:**
- **OLD:** Work harder → hope for promotion → apply to jobs → compete with hundreds
- **NEW:** Choose target market → gain access to hiring managers → ace interviews with preparation → negotiate from strength
