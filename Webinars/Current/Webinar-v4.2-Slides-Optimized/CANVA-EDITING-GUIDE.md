## Key Slides to Enhance First

Focus your Canva editing on these high-impact slides:

### Priority 1: Big Domino Moments

- **Slide 88-1**: "P.R.I.N.T." acronym - make it memorable

### Priority 2: Framework Slides
- **Slide 37-img**: Three Positioning Factors - create diagram
- **Slide 67**: Preparation Framework - add numbered visual
- **Slide 86-img**: Reverse Attraction - create flow diagram
- **Slide 110-img**: Value Stack - create stacking visual

### Priority 3: Proof Slides

## Canva Design Principles

### Keep It Simple
- Don't over-design - clarity > creativity for webinars
- White space is your friend
- One main idea per slide (already implemented in v4.2)

### Use Canva Elements Strategically
**Good additions:**
- Simple icons to reinforce concepts
- Subtle shapes for emphasis
- Before/after visual separators
- Timeline graphics for storytelling

**Avoid:**
- Busy backgrounds that compete with text
- Too many fonts (stick to 1-2 max)
- Overuse of animations
- Decorative elements that don't serve the teaching

### Mobile Preview
Use Canva's preview feature:
- Click "Present" → "Presenter view"
- Check readability on different screen sizes
- Ensure text isn't too small for webinar screens

## Exporting from Canva

**Steps:**
1. Click "Share" (top right)
2. Select "Download"
3. Choose "PDF (Print)"
4. Click "Download"
5. Wait for processing (may take 2-3 minutes for 214+ slides)

### For Further Editing
**Best Format:** PowerPoint

### For Online Sharing
**Best Format:** PDF (Standard)

## Troubleshooting

### "Font not available" in Canva
**Solution:**
- Use **Montserrat** (closest to Helvetica Neue)
- Or use **Helvetica** if you have Canva Pro
- Apply to all slides: Select all → Font dropdown

### Text overflows text box
**Solution:**
- Click text box → Resize handles
- Or reduce font size by 2-4pts
- Or adjust line spacing

### Slides look different from PDF
**Expected:** PowerPoint import won't be pixel-perfect
- Use PDF as visual reference
- Manually adjust layouts in Canva
- Focus on getting the feel right, not exact replication

### Canva won't import PowerPoint
**Solution:**
- File may be too large - try uploading in sections
- Or import first 100 slides, then second 114 slides separately
- Merge in Canva using "Add pages from another design"

## Advanced: Creating Custom Graphics

If you want to create custom graphics for combo slides in Canva:

### Framework Diagrams (e.g., Slide 37-img)
1. Use Canva's "Diagram" elements
2. Search: "3 pillar diagram" or "triangle framework"
3. Customize colors to match (#1a365d, #2c5282, #3182ce)
4. Add labels for WHO, WHICH, HOW

### Data Visualizations (e.g., Slide 84-img)
1. Use Canva's chart tools (Pro feature)
2. Or use "Elements" → "Charts & Diagrams"
3. Input your data
4. Style to match presentation colors

### Timeline Graphics (e.g., Slide 22-img)
1. Search Elements: "timeline horizontal"
2. Customize with your dates
3. Add icons for key milestones
4. Match color scheme

## Version Management

### Naming Convention
When saving in Canva, use clear names:
- "Webinar v4.2 - Master (DO NOT EDIT)"
- "Webinar v4.2 - Working Copy [Date]"
- "Webinar v4.2 - FINAL for [Event Name]"

### Backup Strategy
1. **Master Version:** Keep one pristine copy in Canva
2. **Working Copies:** Duplicate before making changes
3. **Export Backups:** Download PDF after major edits
4. **Local Storage:** Save exported PDFs to this folder
