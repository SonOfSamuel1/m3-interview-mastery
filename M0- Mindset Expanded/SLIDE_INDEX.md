## LESSON 1: The Psychology of High-Ticket Job Searches (8-10 min)

**Slide 1** - Title: "The Psychology of High-Ticket Job Searches"

**Slide 2** - Why Mindset Matters More Than Strategy
- Your mindset determines your actions, and your actions determine your results
- Most job seekers focus on tactics but neglect the psychological foundation
- High-ticket roles require a different level of confidence and positioning
- Hiring managers can sense desperation, scarcity thinking, and lack of confidence
- Premium positioning starts in your mind before it shows up in your messaging

**Slide 3** - The High-Ticket Job Search Mindset
- You are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you
- You bring valuable skills and expertise that solve expensive business problems
- Scarcity vs. Abundance mindset comparison
- Your goal is to find the right high-value opportunity, not any job
- Confidence is not arrogance; it's knowing your worth

**Slide 4** - Common Psychological Barriers
- Imposter syndrome
- Fear of rejection
- Salary anxiety
- Scarcity thinking
- Comparison trap

**Slide 5** - The Cost of the Wrong Mindset
- $50k-$200k+ per year in lost compensation
- $250k-$1M in lost lifetime earnings over 5 years
- 1-2 years of career momentum wasted
- Tens of thousands left on the table in negotiations
- Your mindset compounds your success or stagnation

**Slide 6** - Shifting to a High-Performer Mindset
- View yourself as a business solving problems
- Approach interviews as collaborative discovery
- See compensation as a reflection of value created
- Embrace rejection as data and refinement
- Build evidence of your value

**Slide 7** - The Abundance Mentality in Job Search
- Thousands of companies hiring for high-ticket sales roles
- Multiple opportunities create leverage
- You only need ONE great offer, but options give you power
- Abundance thinking makes you more attractive
- The right opportunity exists

**Slide 8** - Reframing Rejection and Setbacks
- Every "no" brings you closer to the right "yes"
- Rejection is feedback about fit, not worth
- Top performers get rejected often
- Use rejection to refine your approach
- The rejecting company might not be the right fit anyway

**Slide 9** - Building Psychological Resilience
- Separate identity from job search outcomes
- Celebrate small wins
- Develop a support system
- Practice self-compassion
- Remember: building a career, not just finding a job

## LESSON 2: Identifying Your Limiting Beliefs (7-9 min)

**Slide 10** - Title: "Identifying Your Limiting Beliefs"

**Slide 11** - What Are Limiting Beliefs?
- Subconscious assumptions about yourself and what's possible
- Formed from past experiences, family messages, societal conditioning
- Feel like facts but are actually interpretations
- Create self-imposed ceilings on potential and income
- Most people are unaware of beliefs holding them back

**Slide 12** - Common Limiting Beliefs in Job Search

- Step 4: Challenge with counter-evidence
- Step 5: Create new empowering belief with supporting evidence

**Slide 15** - Reframing Exercise: From Limiting to Empowering
- "I'm not qualified" → "I bring unique value they can't find elsewhere"
- "I need more experience" → "I have transferable skills that apply immediately"
- "They won't pay me that much" → "I solve problems worth far more than my salary"
- "I'm bad at interviews" → "I'm learning and improving with each conversation"
- "I don't have connections" → "I'm building relationships strategically"

**Slide 16** - Evidence Collection: Building Your Case

## LESSON 3: Building Unshakeable Confidence (10-12 min)

**Slide 19** - Title: "Building Unshakeable Confidence"

**Slide 20** - What Is True Confidence?
- Not arrogance or bravado - quiet self-assurance

- Comes from evidence and preparation, not positive thinking alone
- Being comfortable with uncertainty and embracing growth
- A skill you build through action, not something you wait to feel

**Slide 21** - The Confidence-Action Cycle
- Most people think: Confidence → Action → Results
- Reality: Action → Results → Confidence
- Build confidence by taking action before you feel ready
- Each small action creates evidence that builds more confidence
- Waiting to feel confident keeps you stuck forever

**Slide 22** - The Three Pillars of Career Confidence
- COMPETENCE: You have skills and knowledge that create value
- PREPARATION: You've done the work to be ready

- Past failures: Reframe as learning experiences
- Fear of judgment: Most people are focused on themselves

**Slide 28** - Confidence in High-Stakes Situations
- Nervousness is normal - even top performers feel it
- Channel nervous energy into enthusiasm
- Focus on serving and helping, not proving yourself
- Remember: You're evaluating them too
- Your preparation will carry you through

**Slide 29** - The Compound Effect of Small Confidence Wins
- Send one message today, even if imperfect
- Schedule one informational interview this week
- Apply to one role that feels slightly out of reach
- Ask one question that shows strategic thinking
- Each small action builds evidence and momentum
- Six months of small actions creates massive transformation

**Slide 30** - Maintaining Confidence Through Challenges

## LESSON 4: The 7 Success Habits Deep Dive (12-15 min)

**Slide 31** - Title: "7 Success Habits to Develop Now"

**Slide 32** - Success Habit #1: Have A Specific Vision
- Most people don't have a specific vision
- What do you want? When? Why?

- Vision is about what you're EXCLUDING
- My Challenge: Think about and decide your vision

**Slide 33** - Creating Your Career Vision
- Define your ideal role
- Set specific income goals
- Identify your timeline
- Clarify your why
- Write it down and review daily

**Slide 34** - Success Habit #2: Stop Negotiating With Yourself

- When the alarm goes off...do you wake up?
- When you say you'll go to the gym...do you?
- When you write down goals...do you accomplish them?
- When you say you'll do more prospecting...do you?
- When you say 100% every day...do you do it?

**Slide 35** - Building Non-Negotiable Standards
- Self-trust is built through keeping promises to yourself
- Every negotiation with yourself erodes self-confidence
- Successful people eliminate decision fatigue
- Your job search commitments: daily outreach, weekly applications
- Momentum from keeping promises compounds into success

**Slide 36** - Success Habit #3: Soft Skills Vs. Hard Skills
- Hard skills: tactical stuff you'd do to get sales (can buy)
- Soft skills: you CAN'T buy...you have to develop
- Soft skills: relationship with money, emotional discipline, pressure handling, confidence
- Soft skills are always the limiting factor
- Confidence is one of the biggest soft skills

**Slide 37** - Developing Critical Soft Skills for Job Search

- Relationship building: genuine connections
- Communication: articulating your value clearly

**Slide 39** - Extreme Ownership in Your Job Search
- Your results are a direct reflection of your actions
- Not getting interviews? Your approach needs improvement
- Not getting offers? Your skills need refinement
- Not getting the salary you want? Your negotiation needs work
- Taking ownership gives you power to change outcomes

**Slide 40** - Success Habit #5: Don't Think of Success as Linear
- Most people think of success as a start and a finish. It's not.
- When people think like that...they end up starting many things and finishing nothing
- For example, switching businesses, methods, courses, etc.
- What happens is you end of starting a lot and finishing nothing
- Instead, think of success as planting seeds...then watering and harvesting

**Slide 41** - The Non-Linear Path to Career Success
- Job search progress is not a straight line
- Weeks of silence can be followed by multiple opportunities
- Trust the process even when results aren't visible
- Your consistent actions are accumulating
- Stay committed for at least 60-90 days before pivoting

**Slide 42** - Success Habit #6: Questions Not Statements
- Asking questions opens the mind to solutions
- Statements close the mind to possibility of solutions
- Train yourself to say "how can I?" instead of "I can't"
- "How can I scale this offer up?" vs. "I can't scale this offer up"

**Slide 43** - Empowering Questions for Job Search
- Instead of "I can't get interviews" → "How can I improve my approach?"
- Instead of "I'm not qualified" → "How can I position my experience to highlight value?"
- Instead of "I won't get that salary" → "How can I negotiate for the compensation I deserve?"
- Instead of "I don't have connections" → "How can I strategically build relationships?"
- Questions activate problem-solving; statements activate defensiveness

**Slide 44** - Success Habit #7: Be A Shark
- What do sharks do?
- Does the shark ever wake up and decide not to do shark things that day? No!
- Same goes for you as a salesperson and entrepreneur
- Get up every day and do whatever it takes to be successful
- Hunt down your goals with the same ferocity that a shark would

**Slide 45** - Relentless Execution in Your Job Search
- Show up every day with consistent effort
- Maintain your rhythm even during slow periods
