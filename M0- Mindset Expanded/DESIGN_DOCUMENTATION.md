- Font Family: Helvetica (system font)
- Title Slides: 120pt, centered
- Content Slide Titles: 80pt, left-aligned
- Body Text: 52pt, left-aligned with bullet points
- Small Text: 44pt (used sparingly for dense content)

**Layout Principles:**

3. **Presentation Flexibility:** Instructor becomes the visual focal point in video lessons
4. **Accessibility:** High contrast (black on light gray) ensures readability

## Content Philosophy

### High-Ticket Course Design Principles
