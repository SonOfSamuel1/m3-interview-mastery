This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a content repository for the **Active Offer** course - a structured career development and job search program. The repository contains course materials, student resources, and internal documentation.

## Repository Structure

### Course Modules (M0-M5)
- **M0- Course Intro**: Introduction module with 4 slides
- **M0- Mindset**: Foundational mindset content with 8 slides
- **M1- Profile Matching**: 32 slides covering profile optimization

- **M3- Interview Mastery**: 23 slides on interview preparation
- **M4- Negotiating the Offer**: 15 slides on negotiation tactics
- **M5- Tell Your Story**: 11 slides on personal branding

All course content is delivered as PNG images (slide exports), numbered sequentially (1.png, 2.png, etc.)

### Supporting Resources

**External Assets/** - Student-facing resources:
- Accountability Log
- Cold Email & Linkedin Vault
- Interview Questions for Top Companies
- LinkedIn Audit Checklist
- Presentation Template
- Resume Template
- Target Account Selector Tool

**Internal Tools/** - Internal use only:
- Comp Negotiator Tool

**Internal Documents/** - Internal documentation (currently empty)

**Internal SOPs/** - Standard operating procedures (currently empty)

**.Webinar Script/** - Webinar presentation with 198 slides

## Content Organization

- Course modules follow a sequential numbering pattern (M0, M1, M2, etc.)
- Each module contains numbered PNG slide images
- External assets are organized by resource type in separate folders
- The webinar script is a standalone presentation separate from the core modules

## Working with This Repository

When adding or modifying content:
1. Maintain the existing naming convention for modules and slides
2. Keep slide numbers sequential within each module
3. Store student-facing resources in "External Assets/"
4. Store internal tools and documentation in respective "Internal" folders
5. Preserve the folder structure when reorganizing content

## Git Workflow

The repository uses a simple main branch workflow. When committing changes:
- Be descriptive about which module or resource was modified
- Group related changes (e.g., "Add M3 slides 15-20" or "Update Resume Template")
