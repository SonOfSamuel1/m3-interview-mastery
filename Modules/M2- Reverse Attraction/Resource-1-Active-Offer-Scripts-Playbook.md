Subject: Introduction from David Chen - Marcus Thompson

Sarah,

David Chen suggested I reach out regarding enterprise sales opportunities at HubSpot.

Brief background: I'm a Senior AE at Salesforce with 8 years in marketing automation and sales enablement. David and I worked together at Oracle from 2019-2021, and he thought my experience in driving platform adoption and expansion revenue might be relevant as HubSpot scales the enterprise segment.

Recent achievements:
- $6.8M in expansion revenue from existing accounts (2023-2024)
- 156% quota attainment average over 4 years
- 41% reduction in time-to-value through customer success collaboration

David speaks highly of you and the work you're doing at HubSpot. Would you be open to a brief conversation to explore whether there might be alignment?

Appreciate your time,
Marcus Thompson

```
[First Name],

Fantastic! Really appreciate you getting back to me.

I have availability:
- [Day 1], [Date] at [Time] or [Time] [Timezone]
- [Day 2], [Date] at [Time] or [Time] [Timezone]
- [Day 3], [Date] at [Time] or [Time] [Timezone]

Let me know what works best and I'll send a calendar invite. Happy to work around your schedule if none of these times align.

I'll come prepared to discuss [Specific Topics Relevant to Their Needs] and share specific examples of how I've [Relevant Achievement/Approach].

Looking forward to it!

### Response 2: They Ask for Resume - Position Yourself

**Situation:** They want to see your resume before scheduling a call

**Your Response:**
```
[First Name],

Absolutely - resume attached.

A few highlights that might be particularly relevant to [Company]:

1. [Achievement #1 with metric] - This is similar to the challenge you're likely facing with [Their Challenge]

2. [Achievement #2 with metric] - I developed this capability at [Company] when we were [Similar Situation to Theirs]

3. [Achievement #3 with metric] - This resulted in [Outcome Relevant to Them]

Let me know if you need anything else!

[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**Why This Works:** Sends resume but also provides interpretive layer highlighting relevance. Keeps momentum toward call.

---

### Response 3: They Say "No Openings" - Stay on Radar

**Situation:** They respond but say they're not currently hiring

**Your Response:**
```
[First Name],

Totally understand - thanks for getting back to me and for being direct.

Quick question: would you be comfortable if I stayed in touch? I'm genuinely interested in [Company] beyond just immediate opportunities, and I'd love to be on your radar for when headcount does open up.

I'll check back in [Timeframe - typically Q1, Q2, etc.] unless I hear from you sooner.

Also, since you're well-connected in [Industry/Space], would you be comfortable pointing me toward other leaders who might be building teams right now? Happy to send you a brief blurb you can forward.

Either way, really appreciate your time. Best of luck with [Specific Initiative if You Know It].

[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:** Gracious, not pushy. Asks for future consideration and referrals. Maintains relationship.

---

### Response 4: They Ask About Compensation - Navigate Carefully

**Situation:** They ask about salary expectations before you've established value

**Your Response (Early Stage - Before Interview):**
```
[First Name],

Great question. I'm currently in the [Low-Mid-High $XXXk] range, but I'm flexible for the right opportunity with strong growth potential.

That said, I'm more focused on the opportunity, team, and growth trajectory than hitting a specific number. I'd love to learn more about the role and what success looks like before getting into specifics on comp.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss the role in more detail? Happy to revisit compensation once we both have a better sense of fit.

[Your Name]
```

**Your Response (Later Stage - After Interview):**
```
[First Name],

Based on my research of [Job Title] roles at [Similar Companies/Stage], I'm seeing base compensation in the [$XXX,000 - $XXX,000] range with OTE around [$XXX,000 - $XXX,000].

Given my track record of [Key Achievement], I'd be targeting the higher end of that range, but I'm open to discussion based on the full package (equity, accelerators, commission structure, etc.).

What range did you have in mind for this role?

[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:** Early stage - deflects without being evasive, refocuses on value. Later stage - shows research, provides range, asks for their range.

---

### Response 5: They Go Silent After Initial Interest - Re-Engage

**Situation:** They expressed interest initially, maybe even scheduled a call, then went dark

**Your Response (7-10 days after silence):**
```
[First Name],

Following up on our conversation from [Date/Last Week]. I know things get busy - just wanted to check if you're still interested in connecting or if timing has shifted.

Since we last spoke, [New Development on Your End - new achievement, relevant experience, something that adds value].

I'm still very interested in [Company/Role] and happy to work around your schedule. If now isn't the right time, I completely understand - just let me know and I'll circle back later.

```

**Why This Works:** Assumes good intent, adds new value, provides easy out, reiterates interest.

---

### Response 6: They Refer You to Someone Else - Leverage the Intro

**Situation:** They're not the right person but refer you to someone else

**Your Response:**
```
[First Name],

Really appreciate you pointing me in the right direction - thank you!

Would you be comfortable making a brief introduction to [Person They Mentioned], or should I reach out directly and mention you suggested I connect?

Either way works for me, whatever's easiest on your end.

Thanks again for your help - means a lot.

[Your Name]
```

**Then, When Reaching Out to the Referral:**
```
[New Person's First Name],

[Referrer's Name] suggested I reach out to you regarding [Topic/Opportunity] at [Company].

Brief background: [One-sentence description of who you are and key credential]

[Referrer] mentioned you're [Leading/Building/Responsible for] [Relevant Area], which aligns closely with my background in [Your Specialty].

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'm happy to share more about my experience and learn about what you're building.

Appreciate your time,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**Why This Works:** Respects their time by asking how they prefer to make intro. Leverages their name appropriately when reaching out.

---

### Response 7: They Schedule a Call - Confirm and Prep

**Situation:** They've agreed to a specific time and you need to confirm

**Your Response:**
```
[First Name],

Perfect! [Day], [Date] at [Time] [Timezone] is confirmed on my end.

I'll send a calendar invite to this email - let me know if you'd prefer a different one.

To make the best use of our time, are there any specific topics or questions you'd like me to come prepared to discuss?

On my end, I'm planning to cover:
- [Topic 1 Relevant to Role]

Looking forward to it! I'm at [Phone] if anything comes up.

**Situation:** They've decided not to move forward with you

**Your Response:**
```
[First Name],

Thanks for letting me know, and I really appreciate you taking the time to consider me for the role.

While I'm disappointed, I have tremendous respect for [Company] and what you're building. I'd love to stay connected for future opportunities if you're open to it.

Quick question: is there any feedback you can share about my candidacy? I'm always looking to improve, and any insights would be genuinely helpful.

Wishing you and the team the best. I'll keep following [Company]'s progress, and perhaps our paths will cross again down the road.

[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:** Gracious, professional, asks for feedback (rarely given but worth asking), keeps door open for future.

## Personalization Before-and-After Examples

### Example 1: LinkedIn Message

**BEFORE (Generic):**
```
Hi Sarah,

I'm an experienced sales professional looking for new opportunities. I have 7 years in SaaS and have consistently exceeded quota. I noticed you're hiring at HubSpot and would love to discuss potential opportunities.

Can we connect?

Thanks,
Marcus
```

**AFTER (Personalized):**
```
Sarah,

Saw your post last week about the shift from SMB to enterprise at HubSpot. Your point about needing AEs who can navigate longer sales cycles really resonated - I made this exact transition at Salesforce and grew my avg deal size from $42K to $280K.

I'm currently a Senior AE at Salesforce with 7 years in marketing automation, specifically focused on complex enterprise deployments. I've reduced time-to-value by 41% through a customer success collaboration framework.

HubSpot's enterprise expansion aligns perfectly with where I want to take my career. Open to a brief conversation about whether there's fit?

Marcus
```

**What Changed:**
- Referenced her specific post
- Tied her insight to personal experience
- Specific company and metrics (not just "7 years in SaaS")
- Connected personal goal to company initiative
- Professional but warm tone

---

### Example 2: Email

**BEFORE (Generic):**

Subject: Enterprise Sales background for Snowflake - John Smith

Jennifer,

I'm reaching out because Snowflake is expanding aggressively into financial services, and this is exactly where I've built my career.

Current role: Senior Enterprise AE at Databricks
Key results:
- $8.2M closed in regulated industries (2023-2024)
- 147% quota attainment over 18 months
- Built repeatable security/compliance review process reducing cycle time 35%

I specialize in selling data infrastructure to highly regulated organizations. Having closed deals with Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, and State Street, I've developed a systematic approach to navigating FINRA and SOC 2 procurement requirements.

I'd love to explore whether my experience could be valuable as you scale in financial services. Available for a brief call this week?

Best regards,
John Smith

## Final Tips for Using This Playbook

**DO:**
- ✓ Customize every template with research
- ✓ Use [BRACKETS] as your personalization checklist
- ✓ Test 2-3 variations to see what works in your market
- ✓ Track which templates get best response rates
- ✓ Read messages out loud before sending (catches awkward phrasing)
- ✓ Keep messages under word limits (75 for LinkedIn, 150 for email)
- ✓ Send during business hours in their timezone
- ✓ Proofread ruthlessly (typos kill credibility)

**DON'T:**
- ✗ Send templates verbatim without personalization
- ✗ Lie or exaggerate about connections/research
- ✗ Use generic "Dear Hiring Manager"
- ✗ Send at 11pm or 6am
- ✗ Use excessive exclamation points!!!
- ✗ Include salary requirements in initial outreach
- ✗ Attach resume unless they specifically ask
- ✗ Write paragraphs (use short sentences and bullet points)

**Quality Checkpoints:**
- [ ] I've researched this person for at least 3 minutes
- [ ] I've referenced something specific to them/their company
- [ ] My value prop is clear in under 30 seconds of reading
- [ ] I've included specific metrics, not just claims
- [ ] My ask is specific and easy to respond to
- [ ] I've proofread at least twice
- [ ] Message is under word limit
- [ ] Tone matches their communication style

---

**Remember:** These templates are starting points, not scripts. The best messages combine proven structure with authentic personalization. Your goal is to sound professional, prepared, and genuinely interested - not like you're copy-pasting.

The hiring managers who respond best are the ones who feel you've done your homework and you're reaching out to THEM specifically, not blasting 100 people with the same message.

Good luck!
