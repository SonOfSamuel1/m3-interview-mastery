## TEMPLATE CATEGORY 2: Negotiation Counter-Offers

### Template 2.1: Standard Counter (Market Data + Value)

**When to use**: You've reviewed the offer and are countering based on market research and your value.

**Subject**: Re: [Position Title] Offer Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you again for the offer for the [Position Title] role. I'm genuinely excited about [specific aspect of the role/company] and the opportunity to contribute to [team goal/company mission].

I've had a chance to review the offer in detail and do some market research. Based on:
- Data from [Levels.fyi / Glassdoor / Payscale / industry peers] showing this role in the $[X]-$[Y] range
- My specific background in [your unique skill/experience], which directly addresses [their challenge]
- The value I'll bring, particularly [specific outcome you'll deliver]

**I'm looking for a base salary of $[YOUR REQUEST].**

I'm confident I can deliver [specific result] within my first [3/6/12] months, which would represent significant ROI on this investment.

I'm flexible on how we structure the compensation package. If there are constraints on base salary, we could explore:
- Increasing the signing bonus
- Adjusting the equity grant
- [Other component flexibility]

The most important thing for me is reaching a total compensation of approximately $[YOUR TOTAL COMP TARGET] in year one.

Are you available for a call this week to discuss? I'm happy to walk through my thinking and find a structure that works for both of us.

Looking forward to continuing our conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 2.2: Counter with Competing Offer

**When to use**: You have another offer and want to use it as leverage (while staying professional).

**Subject**: Re: [Position Title] Offer

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the offer. I want to be transparent with you about where I am in my process.

I'm currently evaluating [one other offer / two other offers] for similar [roles / positions]. The most competitive is at $[X] base salary [with X equity / with Y bonus structure / etc.].

I'm most excited about this opportunity at [Company Name] because [GENUINE, SPECIFIC REASONS - be authentic here]:
- [Reason 1: specific to the role, team, mission]
- [Reason 2: specific growth opportunity]
- [Reason 3: cultural or value alignment]

However, compensation is a meaningful factor in my decision. **If we could get to $[YOUR REQUEST] base salary**, [this becomes my clear top choice / it would make this decision straightforward / I'd be prepared to accept immediately].

I understand there may be budget constraints. If $[YOUR REQUEST] isn't feasible for base salary, I'm open to discussing how we could structure the total compensation package differently - perhaps through:
- A larger signing bonus
- Increased equity
- [Other creative options]

My target total compensation is $[YOUR TOTAL COMP TARGET].

I have to make a decision by [DEADLINE - if you have one], so I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss this soon. Are you available for a call [this week / in the next few days]?

I'm hopeful we can find a path forward.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 2.3: Counter When Below Current Compensation

**When to use**: The offer is below your current total compensation and you need to address that gap.

**Subject**: Re: [Position Title] Offer - Compensation Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the offer. I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to work on [specific initiative] and join the [team name] team.

I want to share some context on my current compensation situation. When I calculate my total compensation using a comprehensive framework (base + bonus + equity + benefits), my current package is approximately $[YOUR CURRENT TOTAL COMP].

The offered package at [Company Name] - when I calculate it the same way - comes to approximately $[THEIR OFFER TOTAL COMP], which represents a [X]% decrease.

While I understand [Company Name] may structure compensation differently, and I'm genuinely attracted to this opportunity for reasons beyond compensation, **I would need to see total compensation of at least $[YOUR MINIMUM]** to make this transition make sense financially.

Some ways we could structure this:
- **Option A**: $[X] base + $[Y] signing bonus + [equity details]
- **Option B**: $[X] base + [different equity structure] + [other component]
- **Option C**: $[X] total comp structured however is most feasible for [Company Name]

I'm flexible on the structure - the key for me is the total compensation number.

Would you have time to discuss this week? I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.

Best,
[Your Name]

## TEMPLATE CATEGORY 3: Responding to Objections

### Template 3.1: Response to "That's Above Our Budget"

**When to use**: They've said your request exceeds their budget.

**Subject**: Re: Budget Discussion - Alternative Structures

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you for being direct about the budget constraints - I appreciate the transparency.

I'd like to explore some alternatives to see if we can find a creative solution:

**Question 1**: Is the constraint specifically on base salary, or on total compensation?

**Question 2**: If base salary has limited flexibility, are there other components with more room to adjust? For example:
- Signing bonus
- Equity/RSU grant
- Performance bonus guarantee
- Professional development budget
- Additional PTO
- [Other relevant component]

**Question 3**: Would a performance-based structure be possible? For example:
- Starting at $[THEIR OFFER] with a 6-month review and adjustment to $[YOUR REQUEST] based on [clearly defined milestones]
- Starting at $[COMPROMISE] with a guaranteed increase to $[YOUR REQUEST] at the 1-year mark

The reason I'm exploring these options is that there's still a gap of approximately $[X] between the current offer and [my minimum requirement / market rate / my other offer].

My goal isn't to create difficulties - I'm trying to find a path that works for both of us. Which of these approaches feels most feasible from your perspective?

I'm available to discuss [specific times] if you'd like to talk through options.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 3.2: Response to "This Is Our Final Offer"

**When to use**: They've stated the offer is final and non-negotiable.

**Subject**: Re: Offer Discussion - Clarifying Questions

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you for clarifying that this is the final offer. I appreciate your directness.

Before I make my decision, I'd like to ask a few questions to make sure I fully understand the situation:

1. Is the "final" nature of the offer related to **base salary specifically**, or to **all components** of the compensation package?

2. Are there any components that weren't included in the original offer that we could add? For example:
   - Signing bonus
   - Relocation assistance (if applicable)
   - Professional development budget
   - Home office stipend (for remote roles)
   - Additional PTO days

3. Is there any possibility of a **performance-based review** after [6 months / 1 year] with a pre-committed salary adjustment if I hit clearly defined goals?

4. Could you share the **reasoning** behind the offer amount? Understanding whether this is a budget constraint, pay band limitation, or other factor would help me make my decision.

The reason I'm asking these questions is that there's still a meaningful gap between this offer and [my minimum / market rate / competing offer] - approximately $[X].

I'm genuinely interested in this role and want to exhaust all options before making a final decision.

Are you available for a brief call to discuss these questions?

Thank you for working with me on this.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 3.3: Response to "We Have Other Qualified Candidates"

**When to use**: They've implied you're not their only option (pressure tactic).

**Subject**: Re: Offer Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I appreciate your transparency. I want to be equally transparent with you.

I understand you may have other strong candidates. I'm also [evaluating other opportunities / considering staying in my current role / in conversations with other companies].

However, I'm most excited about this opportunity at [Company Name] because [SPECIFIC, GENUINE REASONS]:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

My compensation request of $[YOUR NUMBER] isn't arbitrary - it's based on:
- Market data for this role ([$X-$Y range from Levels.fyi / Glassdoor])
- The specific value I bring, particularly [your unique differentiator]
- [My current compensation / My other offer / Market scarcity for this profile]

I'm not trying to create friction. I'm trying to ensure the compensation reflects the value I'll deliver. Based on our conversations about [their specific challenge], I'm confident I can achieve [specific outcome] within [timeframe], which would represent [ROI calculation].

I'm willing to be flexible on **how** we structure the compensation - whether through base, bonus, equity, or other components. But my target total compensation is $[YOUR NUMBER].

If you believe another candidate can deliver the same value at a lower cost, I respect that decision. But if you want **me specifically** - for the reasons we've discussed - then I'd need us to find a way to bridge this gap.

Can we schedule a call to discuss potential paths forward?

Best,
[Your Name]

## TEMPLATE CATEGORY 4: Specific Component Negotiations

### Template 4.1: Signing Bonus Request

**When to use**: Base salary is constrained but you want to negotiate a signing bonus.

**Subject**: Re: Offer - Signing Bonus Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the conversation earlier about base salary. I understand there are constraints at the $[X] level.

I'd like to propose a solution: **What if we bridged the gap with a signing bonus?**

Here's my thinking:
- My target total compensation is $[YOUR TOTAL COMP TARGET]
- At $[THEIR BASE OFFER], there's a gap of approximately $[X]
- A signing bonus of $[AMOUNT] would bridge most of this gap for year one
- This is a one-time cost rather than an ongoing salary increase

From my research, signing bonuses in the $[X]-$[Y] range are common for this level, especially when bringing in experienced candidates from [your industry/background].

Additionally, I'd be leaving behind [unvested equity / annual bonus / other compensation] at my current company, so this would help offset that loss.

Would a signing bonus of $[YOUR REQUEST] be possible? This would get us to a total year-one package that works for me while keeping the base salary within your band.

Let me know your thoughts - happy to discuss further.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 4.2: Equity Increase Request

**When to use**: Base is fixed but you want to negotiate equity.

**Subject**: Re: Equity Grant Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you for clarifying that base salary is fixed at $[X] due to band limitations. I appreciate the transparency.

I'd like to discuss the equity component of the offer. The current grant is [NUMBER] [options/RSUs], which represents approximately $[VALUE] annually over the vesting period.

Given that base salary can't be adjusted, **would there be flexibility to increase the equity grant by [20-40%]?**

Here's why I believe this makes sense:
- It would bring total compensation closer to my target of $[YOUR TOTAL COMP]
- It aligns my long-term incentives with the company's success
- It's lower cash impact than increasing base salary
- It's common for companies to provide larger equity grants when base salary is constrained

A grant of [NEW NUMBER] [options/RSUs] would close most of the gap and make this package competitive with [market rates / my other offer / my current comp].

From my understanding of [Company Name]'s growth trajectory and [specific catalysts - funding round, product launch, etc.], I'm optimistic about the value of this equity, which is why I'm comfortable with this structure.

Is this something we can explore?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 4.3: Additional PTO Request

**When to use**: You want to negotiate more vacation days.

**Subject**: Re: PTO Policy Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on one component of the offer: the PTO policy.

The offer includes [X] days of PTO annually. In my current role, I have [Y] days, and [I've grown accustomed to that flexibility / it's been important for my work-life balance / it's a meaningful benefit for me].

**Would it be possible to start with [X+3 to X+5] days of PTO?**

I understand this may be outside the standard policy, but here's why I'm requesting this:
- It would help bridge the gap between this offer and my current benefits package
- PTO is a relatively low-cost benefit for the company
- It would allow me to [maintain work-life balance / accommodate existing commitments / etc.]
- It reflects my experience level and the value I'll bring

If adding PTO days company-wide isn't feasible, would it be possible to [add them to my specific offer / have a written commitment to increase PTO after 1 year]?

This is an important factor in my decision, and having [YOUR REQUEST] days would make a meaningful difference.

Thank you for considering this.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 4.4: Remote Work Flexibility Request

**When to use**: You want to negotiate work location flexibility.

**Subject**: Re: Work Arrangement Discussion

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I wanted to discuss the work arrangement expectations for this role.

My understanding from our conversations is that the expectation is [fully in-office / hybrid X days per week / primarily in-office].

**I'd like to propose a fully remote arrangement** [OR: **I'd like to propose X days remote per week** instead of Y].

Here's my reasoning:
- **Productivity**: In my current role, I've been [remote/hybrid] for [timeframe] and have delivered [specific results], demonstrating my ability to be productive independently
- **Work style**: The nature of this role - [specific responsibilities] - doesn't require daily in-office presence
- **Cost**: This would save me approximately [X hours and $Y] per week in commute time and costs
- **Flexibility**: I could use that time to [be more productive / attend more meetings across time zones / etc.]

I'm committed to:
- Being available during [specific core hours]
- Traveling to the office [monthly / quarterly / as needed] for key meetings, team events, and collaboration
- Maintaining strong communication and visibility with the team
- [Any other commitments that address potential concerns]

Would this arrangement be possible? If full remote isn't feasible, could we start with [compromise option] and revisit after [timeframe] based on performance?

This is a meaningful factor in my decision, and I wanted to raise it before finalizing the offer.

Happy to discuss further.

Best,
[Your Name]
