# Framework 2: The Value Triangle™

## Framework Overview

**Purpose**: Provide students with a proven methodology to articulate their unique value in negotiation conversations, justifying compensation above initial offers.

**Problem It Solves**: Most candidates say "I have X years of experience" or "I have strong skills" - generic statements that don't differentiate them or justify higher compensation. The Value Triangle™ gives you a systematic way to present compelling, specific value.

**Key Insight**: Employers don't pay for experience or skills alone. They pay for the **intersection of Skills + Results + Scarcity**. When you can demonstrate all three, you have maximum negotiating leverage.

## ELEMENT 1: Skills (What You Can Do)

### Definition
The specific, demonstrable competencies and expertise you bring that are directly relevant to the role's requirements and challenges.

### Why Skills Matter
Skills answer the question: "**Can this person do the job?**"

Without the right skills, you won't get hired. But skills alone don't justify premium compensation - 50 other candidates might have the same skills. Skills are **necessary but not sufficient**.

### Types of Skills That Matter

**Technical Skills** (Hard Skills):
- Programming languages, frameworks, tools
- Data analysis, statistical modeling
- Design software proficiency
- Industry-specific certifications
- Platform expertise (Salesforce, AWS, etc.)

**Domain Expertise**:
- Deep knowledge of specific industry (fintech, healthcare, SaaS)
- Regulatory knowledge (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR)
- Market segment understanding (enterprise vs SMB)
- Category expertise (payments, security, analytics)

**Leadership & Soft Skills**:
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Stakeholder management
- Conflict resolution
- Strategic thinking
- Communication (written, verbal, presentation)

**Unique Skill Combinations**:
- Technical + Business (engineering + MBA)
- Design + Development (full-stack designer)
- Sales + Product (technical sales engineer)

### How to Present Skills in Negotiation

**Weak approach** (what most candidates do):
"I have 8 years of experience in product management and strong leadership skills."

**Value Triangle™ approach**:
"I bring the specific combination of **enterprise SaaS product experience** and **B2B marketplace expertise** that this role requires. In my last role, I shipped 3 marketplace features that required deep understanding of both buyer and seller incentives - exactly what you need for this two-sided marketplace product."

### Skills Documentation Worksheet

**For each required skill in the job description, document:**

| Required Skill | Your Evidence | Depth of Expertise | Unique Differentiator |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| AWS architecture | 5 years architecting cloud infrastructure | Led migration of 200+ microservices | Certified Solutions Architect Professional |
| Team leadership | Managed teams of 8-12 engineers | Built team from 0 to 15 in 18 months | Expertise in scaling startups specifically |
| API design | Designed 30+ RESTful APIs | Created API design standards adopted company-wide | Published thought leadership on API versioning |

### Skills Gap Analysis

**Critical skill hierarchy:**

1. **Must-have skills**: Listed in job requirements
   - If you lack these: Difficult to justify premium compensation
   - If you exceed these: Negotiation leverage

2. **Nice-to-have skills**: Mentioned as "preferred" or bonus
   - Each one you have = Additional leverage
   - Unique combinations = Maximum leverage

3. **Unstated critical skills**: What you know they need but didn't list
   - Identify through company research
   - Bring these up proactively = Demonstrate insight

**Example**:
Job description says: "5+ years product management experience required"

**Basic response**: "I have 7 years of PM experience"

**Value Triangle™ response**: "I have 7 years of PM experience, but more importantly, 4 of those years are specifically in **regulated healthcare SaaS** - which I noticed is exactly where you're expanding based on your Series B announcement. I've already navigated the HIPAA compliance challenges you're about to face."

### Red Flags (Skills that hurt your case)

- **Outdated skills**: Technologies or methods no longer relevant
- **Mismatched skills**: Impressive but not relevant to this role
- **Shallow breadth**: "Familiar with" 30 technologies but expert in none
- **No recent application**: Haven't used the skill in 3+ years

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Element 1: Skills - What Makes You CAPABLE"

**Content**:
- Skills answer "Can you do this job?" - But so can 50 other candidates
- Focus on **relevant** skills specifically required for THIS role
- Highlight unique skill combinations that create differentiation
- Domain expertise often matters more than years of experience
- **The key**: Match your skills to their unstated challenges

**Visual**: Venn diagram showing "Required Skills" overlapping with "Your Skills" - highlight the perfect overlap plus your unique additional skills

---

## ELEMENT 2: Results (What You've Achieved)

### Definition
Quantifiable outcomes and measurable impact you've delivered using your skills in previous roles - proof that you don't just have capabilities, but that you apply them to create business value.

### Why Results Matter
Results answer the question: "**What will this person accomplish for us?**"

Skills show potential. Results show **proven performance**. Results are the difference between "I can do this" and "I've done this before and here's the impact."

### The Results Formula

```
RESULT = Action + Metric + Business Impact

Weak: "Improved the website"
Strong: "Redesigned checkout flow, increasing conversion rate by 23%, generating $1.2M in additional annual revenue"

Weak: "Led a team"
Strong: "Built and led an 8-person engineering team that shipped 15 features on time, reducing customer churn by 18%"
```

### Types of Results That Matter

**Revenue Impact**:
- "Increased sales by X%"
- "Generated $X in new revenue"
- "Expanded into new market worth $X"
- "Launched product that reached $X ARR in Y months"

**Cost Savings**:
- "Reduced infrastructure costs by $X annually"
- "Automated process saving X hours per week"
- "Negotiated vendor contracts saving $X"
- "Eliminated redundant tools, saving $X/year"

**Efficiency Gains**:
- "Reduced deployment time from X days to Y hours"
- "Increased team velocity by X%"
- "Decreased time-to-market by X weeks"
- "Improved process efficiency by X%"

**Customer Impact**:
- "Increased NPS from X to Y"
- "Reduced customer churn by X%"
- "Grew user base from X to Y users"
- "Improved product rating from X to Y stars"

**Team/Organizational Impact**:
- "Hired and onboarded X employees in Y months"
- "Established process adopted by X teams"
- "Mentored X employees who were promoted"
- "Built practice that generated X in consulting revenue"

### Quantifying the "Unquantifiable"

**Challenge**: "My work doesn't have clear metrics"

**Solution**: Every role has measurable impact - you just need to dig deeper.

**Examples**:

| Role | "Unquantifiable" Work | Quantified Result |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Designer | "Made the app more user-friendly" | "Redesigned onboarding flow, increasing completion rate from 60% to 84% (24% improvement)" |
| HR Manager | "Improved company culture" | "Launched employee engagement program, increasing eNPS from 32 to 58 and reducing turnover from 28% to 15%" |
| Operations | "Streamlined processes" | "Documented and automated invoice processing, reducing manual work from 20 hours/week to 2 hours/week (90% reduction)" |
| Consultant | "Provided strategic guidance" | "Advised client on market entry strategy that resulted in successful launch in 3 new regions, adding $4M in revenue" |

### The "Before → After → Business Impact" Story Structure

**Formula**:
1. **Before**: Describe the problem/situation
2. **After**: State what you did and the measurable change
3. **Business Impact**: Connect to revenue, costs, or strategic goals

**Example**:

**Before**: "When I joined, the sales team had no formal onboarding process. New reps took 6+ months to ramp and hit quota."

**After**: "I created a structured 30-day onboarding program with certifications and shadowing milestones, reducing time-to-productivity from 6 months to 2.5 months."

**Business Impact**: "This meant new reps generated revenue 3.5 months earlier, adding approximately $280K per new hire in year-one revenue. With 12 new sales hires that year, that's $3.36M in accelerated revenue."

### Your Results Inventory

**Create a master list of your top 15-20 quantified achievements:**

| Result Category | Specific Achievement | Metric/Quantification | Business Value |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Revenue Growth | Launched new pricing tier | Added $2.4M ARR | Enabled upmarket expansion |
| Efficiency | Automated reporting process | Saved 15 hours/week across team | $78K annual labor savings |
| Product Launch | Shipped mobile app | 50K downloads in 3 months | Opened new customer segment |
| Team Building | Grew engineering team | 0 to 12 engineers in 15 months | Increased product velocity 3x |

**How to use this in negotiation:**

When you present value, you pull from this inventory:

"In my current role, I've consistently delivered measurable business impact: [Result #1], [Result #2], and [Result #3]. Based on the challenges you've described - particularly [their specific problem] - I'd apply the same approach to [specific outcome they'd value]."

### Making Results Relevant to NEW Role

**The Bridge Statement**:

"In my previous role at [Company], I [Result]. I see a similar challenge here at [New Company] with [their specific situation], and I'd approach it by [your strategy], which I expect would [projected outcome]."

**Example**:

"At my last company, I reduced customer churn by 18% by implementing a proactive outreach program to at-risk accounts. I noticed in your Q2 earnings call that churn has increased to 8% - if I could achieve even half my previous impact, that would represent approximately $2.2M in retained ARR based on your $55M ARR figure."

**Why this works**:
- Shows you've researched their business
- Demonstrates your results are transferable
- Quantifies your potential value to THEM
- Creates an ROI justification for your compensation request

### Red Flags (Results that hurt your case)

- **Vague, unquantified results**: "Improved efficiency" (by how much?)
- **Team results without individual contribution**: "Our team grew revenue by $10M" (what was YOUR role?)
- **Old results**: Only citing achievements from 5+ years ago
- **Irrelevant results**: Impressive but not related to this role
- **Inflated metrics**: Results that seem implausible without context

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Element 2: Results - What You've PROVEN You Can Deliver"

**Content**:
- Results are PROOF - they show you don't just have potential, you produce outcomes
- Every result needs a number: Revenue gained, costs saved, efficiency improved
- Use the formula: Action + Metric + Business Impact
- Make results relevant: Bridge from past achievements to future value
- **The key**: Show them the ROI of hiring you at your target compensation

**Visual**: Before/After comparison of 2-3 of your strongest results with metrics highlighted

## ELEMENT 3: Scarcity (Why You're Hard to Replace)

### Definition
The elements that make you rare, difficult to find, or uniquely positioned - creating competitive demand for your capabilities and justifying premium compensation.

### Why Scarcity Matters
Scarcity answers the question: "**Why should we pay YOU more than other candidates?**"

Basic economics: When supply is limited and demand is high, prices (compensation) increase. If there are 500 candidates who can do the job with your skills and results, you have limited leverage. If there are 5, you have tremendous leverage.

### Types of Scarcity

**1. Skill Scarcity (Rare Expertise)**
- Niche technical skills in high demand
- Specialized domain knowledge
- Certifications few people have
- Unique skill combinations

**Examples**:
- "One of 200 certified Kubernetes security specialists globally"
- "Deep expertise in BOTH consumer mobile apps AND healthcare compliance"
- "Fluent in Japanese with B2B SaaS product experience" (for expanding to Japan)
- "One of the few PMs with hands-on ML engineering background"

**2. Experience Scarcity (Rare Background)**
- Worked at specific companies in similar stage/industry
- Solved the exact problem they're facing
- Built the exact thing they're building
- Operated at the exact scale they're targeting

**Examples**:
- "I built the marketplace feature at Uber that you're trying to replicate"
- "I've scaled SaaS products from $5M to $50M ARR three times - exactly your growth stage"
- "I was part of the team that took Airbnb public - and you're in your pre-IPO phase"
- "I've launched products in LATAM markets, which is your next expansion region"

**3. Network Scarcity (Access & Relationships)**
- Relationships with key industry players
- Access to specific customer segments
- Personal brand / thought leadership
- Investor or partnership connections

**Examples**:
- "I have existing relationships with 15 of your target enterprise customers from my time at [competitor]"
- "I speak at 5+ industry conferences annually, giving you immediate access to this community"
- "My network includes the founders of your top 10 integration partners"
- "I bring Series B+ investor relationships that could support your next round"

**4. Market Scarcity (Timing & Competition)**
- You have multiple offers (competitive scarcity)
- You're not actively looking (passive candidate premium)
- Similar roles are hiring simultaneously (demand scarcity)
- You're leaving for reasons other than money (retention challenge)

**Examples**:
- "I'm currently evaluating two other offers for similar roles"
- "I'm happy in my current role, but this opportunity is compelling enough to consider"
- "I know Google, Meta, and Stripe are all hiring for this exact role right now"
- "I'm being asked to stay on with a promotion and retention package"

**5. Output Scarcity (Rare Results)**
- You've achieved results few others have
- You've solved problems at extreme difficulty
- You've operated at exceptional scale
- You've achieved unusual speed/quality

**Examples**:
- "I've taken 3 products from zero to $10M+ ARR - a success rate that's statistically rare"
- "I've built engineering teams that achieve <2% annual attrition in a market with 25% average"
- "I shipped 30+ product launches with 100% on-time delivery rate over 4 years"
- "I've managed infrastructure at 1B+ requests/day scale - relevant to your growth plans"

### How to Identify Your Scarcity

**Exercise: The Scarcity Inventory**

Answer these questions:

1. **What do I have/know that fewer than 100 people in the world have/know?**
   - Specific technical expertise?
   - Rare experience combination?
   - Unique domain knowledge?

2. **What have I done that fewer than 1,000 people have done?**
   - Specific achievement?
   - Operated at specific scale?
   - Built specific thing?

3. **What competitive advantages do I bring to this SPECIFIC role?**
   - Have I worked at their competitors?
   - Do I know their target customers?
   - Have I solved this exact problem before?

4. **Why would replacing me be difficult or expensive?**
   - Rare skills requiring months to find?
   - Deep relationships that transfer?
   - Institutional knowledge?

5. **What market conditions create demand for my profile right now?**
   - Hot skills in tech (AI/ML, blockchain, etc.)?
   - Industry growth (everyone hiring similar roles)?
   - Geographic expansion needs?

### The Scarcity Statement

**Formula**: "I'm one of [small number] people who [unique combination]."

**Examples**:

"I'm one of approximately 50 people globally who have **both** led product at a top-10 marketplace company **and** have deep expertise in regulatory compliance - which is exactly what you need as you expand internationally and face new regulatory requirements."

"There are only about 200 DevOps engineers with my specific combination: Kubernetes expertise + fintech security compliance + experience at scale (1B+ transactions/day). Based on my network, I know at least 8 companies are currently trying to hire for this exact profile."

"I'm one of the few senior designers who have **both** led design at an enterprise SaaS company from Series A to IPO **and** have hands-on front-end development skills. This means I can both set strategic vision and unblock engineering - a rare combination."

### Using Scarcity in Negotiation

**Approach 1: Competitive Scarcity**

"I want to be transparent - I'm currently evaluating [X] other opportunities, including [specific company if impressive]. While compensation isn't my only factor, it is a significant one. For me to move forward confidently, I'd need the offer to be at [your number]."

**Approach 2: Expertise Scarcity**

"Based on my research and conversations with peers in this space, there are very few candidates with this specific combination of [skill A], [skill B], and [specific experience]. Given the specialized nature of what you're looking for, I believe [your compensation request] reflects the market rate for this rare profile."

**Approach 3: Value Scarcity**

"If you look at the job description, you're essentially looking for someone who can [achieve X outcome]. I'm one of the few people who has actually done this before - at [previous company], I [specific result]. Given that hiring someone who already knows how to do this will save you 6-12 months of trial and error, I believe investing in [your compensation] will actually save you money."

**Approach 4: Network Scarcity**

"One thing I'd bring that's difficult to replace is access to [specific network/relationships]. In my first 90 days, I could facilitate introductions to [specific value - customers, partners, talent, etc.], which would typically take 12+ months to develop organically. This accelerated network access is worth considering in the total value equation."

### Demonstrating Scarcity Without Bragging

**Weak approach** (comes across as arrogant):
"I'm the best product manager in the industry and you'd be lucky to have me."

**Value Triangle™ approach** (factual, specific, relevant):
"Based on the role requirements, you need someone with both consumer marketplace experience and regulatory compliance expertise. That's a relatively rare combination - I know because I've been recruiting for similar roles and it typically takes 4-6 months to find qualified candidates. I'm fortunate to have both through my time at [Company A] and [Company B]."

**Key principles**:
- Be **specific and factual** rather than making broad claims
- Tie scarcity to **their specific needs**
- Use **market data** when possible ("typically takes 4-6 months to fill")
- Frame as **value to them** rather than your greatness

### Creating Scarcity When You Think You Don't Have It

**Reality check**: If you're getting interviewed, you have some scarcity - they're not interviewing 1,000 people.

**Ways to uncover hidden scarcity**:

1. **Ask the recruiter**: "What made my background stand out? What are you having difficulty finding in other candidates?"

2. **Analyze the job description**: What unique combination of requirements do they list? You have that combination or you wouldn't be talking.

3. **Research market demand**: Are companies desperate for your skill set? Check job boards, LinkedIn recruiter spam, industry reports.

4. **Identify unstated scarcity**: What do you know they need (from research) that isn't obvious? Bring it up proactively.

5. **Create competitive scarcity**: Even if you don't have other offers, say "I'm in active conversations with [X] other companies for similar roles."

### Red Flags (Scarcity claims that hurt your case)

- **False scarcity**: Claiming expertise you don't have (will be discovered)
- **Irrelevant scarcity**: Being rare at something that doesn't matter for this role
- **Arrogant framing**: "You won't find anyone better than me"
- **Fabricated competition**: Lying about other offers
- **Outdated scarcity**: Skills that were rare 5 years ago but are common now

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Element 3: Scarcity - Why You're RARE and VALUABLE"

**Content**:
- Scarcity = Supply vs. Demand. When fewer people can do what you do, compensation increases
- Types of scarcity: Rare skills, unique experience, valuable network, competitive offers, exceptional results
- Your scarcity statement: "I'm one of [small number] who [unique combination]"
- Demonstrate scarcity through specificity, not bragging
- **The key**: Show them why replacing you would be difficult and expensive

**Visual**: Supply/demand curve showing how scarcity drives higher compensation + examples of scarcity statements

## THE COMPLETE VALUE TRIANGLE™: Where All Three Intersect

### The Maximum Value Zone

```
When you can demonstrate:
✓ SKILLS: You CAN do the job (and have rare/relevant expertise)
✓ RESULTS: You HAVE done it before (with proven, quantified outcomes)
✓ SCARCITY: You're HARD TO REPLACE (rare combination or high demand)

= MAXIMUM NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE
```

### The Value Triangle™ Pitch

**Structure**:
1. **Skills**: Establish you have the capabilities they need
2. **Results**: Prove you've delivered impact before
3. **Scarcity**: Explain why you're uniquely valuable
4. **Ask**: Make your compensation request based on this complete value picture

**Example Value Triangle™ Pitch**:

"Thank you for the offer. I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity. Before we finalize compensation, I'd like to share why I believe I bring exceptional value to this role:

**SKILLS**: You're looking for someone with both deep technical expertise in distributed systems and experience leading cross-functional teams. I bring both - 7 years architecting cloud infrastructure at scale, plus 4 years managing engineering teams of 8-15 people.

**RESULTS**: More importantly, I've delivered measurable outcomes with these skills. At [Previous Company], I:
- Led the infrastructure migration that reduced costs by $1.2M annually
- Built and scaled the platform team from 0 to 12 engineers
- Reduced deployment time from 2 weeks to 2 hours, increasing engineering velocity by 40%

**SCARCITY**: This combination - deep technical expertise AND proven ability to scale infrastructure teams at high-growth startups - is relatively rare. I know because I've helped recruit for similar roles and it typically takes 5-6 months to find qualified candidates. Additionally, I'm currently evaluating two other offers for similar positions.

Given this value - the specific skills you need, proven results in similar environments, and the market scarcity of this profile - I believe a compensation package of [your number] reflects fair market value. This would include [breakdown of base/bonus/equity].

I'm confident I can deliver [specific outcome they care about] within my first [timeframe], which would represent [ROI calculation]. I'd love to discuss how we can structure a package that works for both of us."

### The Three-Legged Stool

Think of the Value Triangle™ like a three-legged stool:

**One leg only** (Skills):
"I have the skills you need."
- Negotiating power: LOW
- They think: "So do 100 other candidates"

**Two legs** (Skills + Results):
"I have the skills you need and I've achieved results with them."
- Negotiating power: MEDIUM
- They think: "You're qualified, but we have other qualified candidates"

**Three legs** (Skills + Results + Scarcity):
"I have rare skills you need, proven results delivering impact, and I'm hard to replace."
- Negotiating power: HIGH
- They think: "We need to secure this candidate before someone else does"

### Customizing Your Value Triangle™ for Each Opportunity

**The framework is consistent. The content changes.**

For each negotiation, customize:

1. **Which skills to emphasize**: Focus on the 3-5 most relevant to THIS role
2. **Which results to highlight**: Choose 2-4 results that map to THEIR challenges
3. **Which scarcity to leverage**: Identify what makes you rare for THIS specific opportunity

**Example**:

Same candidate, two different roles:

| Element | For Startup Role | For Enterprise Role |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Skills** | "Startup scaling expertise, 0-to-1 product building, comfort with ambiguity" | "Enterprise sales enablement, stakeholder management, process optimization" |
| **Results** | "Launched 3 products from scratch that reached $5M+ ARR" | "Scaled product org from 15 to 60 people while maintaining quality" |
| **Scarcity** | "I've done 0-to-1 at Series A startups 3 times - rare pattern recognition" | "Few PMs have scaled at both startups AND Fortune 500 companies" |

## COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM

### Mistake 1: Leading with Your Ask
**Wrong**: "I need $150K to accept this role."
**Right**: Present your value first (Value Triangle™), THEN make your ask based on that value.

### Mistake 2: Generic Value Statements
**Wrong**: "I have strong leadership skills and lots of experience."
**Right**: "I've scaled engineering teams from 5 to 25 people while maintaining sub-3% attrition, which is critical for your rapid growth phase."

### Mistake 3: Focusing Only on Years of Experience
**Wrong**: "I have 10 years of experience, so I should be paid at the senior level."
**Right**: "I've delivered [specific results] in [relevant context], which directly translates to value for [their challenge]."

### Mistake 4: Underselling Your Scarcity
**Wrong**: "I'm probably one of many candidates who could do this."
**Right**: "This role requires [specific combination], which is relatively rare - there are approximately [small number] people with this exact background."

### Mistake 5: Not Connecting Value to Their Needs
**Wrong**: "I increased revenue by 40% at my last company."
**Right**: "I increased revenue by 40% at my last company using [specific strategy]. Given your goal to expand in [segment], I'd apply the same approach to achieve [projected outcome]."

## VIDEO LESSON SCRIPT OUTLINE

**Introduction (0:00-2:00)**
"Imagine you're in a salary negotiation and the hiring manager says: 'We like you, but we have other qualified candidates. Why should we pay you $20,000 more than our initial offer?'

What do you say?

Most candidates freeze. Or they say something vague like 'I have lots of experience' or 'I'm really good at what I do.'

That's not convincing.

In this lesson, I'm going to teach you the Value Triangle™ - a framework my students use to articulate their unique value so compellingly that employers WANT to pay them more.

This is the same framework that helped Sarah negotiate a $32,000 increase above the initial offer, and James get a competing employer to beat his current comp by 40%."

**Teaching the Framework (2:00-12:00)**
[Walk through each element with examples and real case studies]

**Application (12:00-15:00)**
"Now I'm going to show you exactly how to build your own Value Triangle™ pitch..."
[Demonstrate filling out the worksheet with a sample candidate profile]

**Conclusion (15:00-16:30)**
"Before this lesson, you might have struggled to explain why you deserve higher compensation beyond 'I have experience.' Now you have a systematic framework: Skills + Results + Scarcity.

Your assignment: Complete the Value Triangle™ worksheet in the resources section. Write out your pitch. Practice it out loud. Time yourself - it should be 2-3 minutes.

Next lesson, we're going to learn the exact words to use when you deliver this pitch - the Reason-Request-Range formula that turns your Value Triangle™ into a specific compensation ask."
