# Framework 3: The Reason-Request-Range Formula

## Framework Overview

**Purpose**: Provide students with the exact verbal and written structure to make confident, specific compensation requests that employers take seriously.

**Problem It Solves**: Most candidates either (1) accept the first offer without negotiating, (2) make vague requests like "Can you do better?", or (3) throw out a number with no justification, which feels arbitrary and gets rejected.

**Key Insight**: How you ask matters as much as what you ask for. The Reason-Request-Range formula gives you a proven structure that feels professional, justified, and opens the door to negotiation rather than closing it.

---

## The Formula: Reason → Request → Range

### The Three Components

```
REASON (Why)
    ↓
REQUEST (What)
    ↓
RANGE (Flexibility)
```

**REASON**: The justification for your ask (based on Value Triangle™)
**REQUEST**: Your specific, confident ask with numbers
**RANGE**: The flexible parameters that invite negotiation

### Why This Order Matters

**WRONG ORDER** (Request → Reason):
"I need $150K. I have lots of experience and I'm really good at this."
- Sounds entitled
- Employer gets defensive before hearing your value
- Feels like an ultimatum

**RIGHT ORDER** (Reason → Request → Range):
"Based on [specific value you bring], I believe [specific number] would be appropriate market compensation. I'm flexible on the structure - we could achieve that through [range of options]."
- Establishes value first
- Request feels justified, not arbitrary
- Invites collaboration rather than confrontation

---

## COMPONENT 1: REASON (The Justification)

### What Makes a Strong Reason

A strong reason is:
- **Specific**: Not vague ("I'm worth more") but concrete ("I bring X skill that solves Y problem")
- **Value-based**: Focused on what you deliver, not what you need ("My rent is high" is NOT a reason)
- **Relevant**: Ties to their specific needs and challenges
- **Grounded**: Uses market data, competing offers, or track record

### Types of Reasons That Work

**1. Market Data Reason**
"Based on my research using Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, and conversations with peers in similar roles, the market rate for this position with my experience level is $X to $Y."

**2. Competing Offer Reason**
"I'm currently evaluating another offer at $X, which is my comparison point for this decision."

**3. Value Delivery Reason**
"Given my track record of [specific results] and the specific challenges you've outlined around [their problem], I believe the value I'll deliver in the first year would be approximately [ROI calculation], which justifies compensation of $X."

**4. Total Compensation Comparison Reason**
"When I calculate the total compensation from this offer using the framework we discussed, it comes to $X. My current total compensation is $Y, which represents a [positive/negative] movement. For me to make this transition, I'd need to see total compensation of at least $Z."

**5. Unique Scarcity Reason**
"This role requires [rare combination of skills/experience]. Based on my network and market research, there are relatively few candidates with this specific background, and similar profiles are currently commanding $X-$Y in the market."

### The Value Triangle™ → Reason Connection

Your REASON should pull from the Value Triangle™:

**Skills-based reason**:
"I bring the specific combination of [Skill A] and [Skill B] that this role requires, which is relatively specialized expertise."

**Results-based reason**:
"I've delivered [specific quantified result] in similar environments, and based on your goals around [their objective], I'm confident I can produce [projected outcome] that would represent [ROI]."

**Scarcity-based reason**:
"I'm one of approximately [small number] people with this exact background [specific rare combination], and I know from recruiting efforts that this profile typically commands $X-$Y."

### Multi-Reason Approach (Strongest)

**Best practice**: Stack 2-3 reasons for maximum impact.

**Example**:
"I want to explain my thinking on compensation:

**First**, based on market research [Market Data Reason], roles at this level with this scope are currently in the $X-$Y range.

**Second**, I'm currently evaluating another offer at $X [Competing Offer Reason], which is my baseline for comparison.

**Third**, given the specific value I bring - particularly my experience with [unique skill/result] [Value Delivery Reason] - I believe I'll be able to deliver [outcome] within my first 6 months, which would represent significant ROI.

For these reasons, I believe [YOUR REQUEST] would be appropriate."

### Reasons to AVOID

**Bad Reason 1: Personal Financial Needs**
"I need $X because I have student loans/mortgage/kids in private school."
- **Why it fails**: Not about value you bring, employers don't owe you personal financial solutions

**Bad Reason 2: Years of Experience Alone**
"I have 10 years of experience, so I should be paid more."
- **Why it fails**: Experience ≠ value. 10 years of mediocre performance doesn't justify premium pay

**Bad Reason 3: Entitlement**
"I deserve more because I'm better than other candidates."
- **Why it fails**: Sounds arrogant without proof. Use your Results from Value Triangle™ instead.

**Bad Reason 4: Previous Salary (If Low)**
"My current salary is $80K, so I need at least $90K."
- **Why it fails**: Anchors you to potentially underpaid previous comp. Focus on market rate instead.

**Bad Reason 5: Vague Value Statements**
"I'll add a lot of value to the team."
- **Why it fails**: Too generic. Quantify the value specifically.

### Crafting Your Personal Reason

**Template**:
"Based on [DATA SOURCE: market research/competing offer/track record], combined with [YOUR UNIQUE VALUE: specific skills/results/scarcity], I believe compensation of [REQUEST] is justified because [THEIR BENEFIT: the outcome you'll deliver]."

**Example**:
"Based on salary data from Levels.fyi and Glassdoor for Senior Product Manager roles in SaaS, combined with my specific track record of taking products from $5M to $50M ARR, I believe compensation of $170K base is justified because I can compress your time-to-market for the enterprise product by 6+ months based on my experience scaling similar products."

---

## COMPONENT 2: REQUEST (The Specific Ask)

### Making a Clear, Confident Request

**Weak requests**:
- "Can you do better?" (vague, puts all power in their hands)
- "I was hoping for more." (passive, no specific ask)
- "What's the best you can do?" (gives up all leverage)
- "I'd love to see if we can increase this." (tentative, unclear)

**Strong requests**:
- "I'm looking for a base salary of $150,000."
- "I'd need total compensation of $200,000 to make this move."
- "I believe $160K base plus a $20K signing bonus would be appropriate."
- "My target compensation is $180,000, which could be structured as $155K base plus $25K in RSUs."

### Request Structure Options

**Option 1: Single Number (Most Common)**
"I'm looking for a base salary of $150,000."
- **Pros**: Clear, confident, easy to evaluate
- **Cons**: Less flexibility, can feel rigid

**Option 2: Total Compensation Target**
"I'm targeting total first-year compensation of $200,000."
- **Pros**: Allows flexibility in structure (base vs. bonus vs. equity)
- **Cons**: Requires you to have calculated total comp accurately

**Option 3: Component-Specific Ask**
"I'd like to discuss increasing the base salary to $145K and the signing bonus to $15K."
- **Pros**: Very specific about what you want changed
- **Cons**: May miss opportunities to optimize other components

**Option 4: Multiple Scenarios**
"Ideally, I'm looking for $160K base. Alternatively, if $150K is the max for base, we could structure it as $150K base plus $15K signing bonus and an additional week of PTO."
- **Pros**: Shows flexibility, gives options
- **Cons**: Can seem indecisive if not framed confidently

### How Much to Ask For

**The Goldilocks Zone**: Not too high (laughable), not too low (leaving money on table), but just right (justified stretch).

**General Guidelines**:

**For base salary negotiations**:
- **Conservative ask**: 5-10% above initial offer
- **Moderate ask**: 10-20% above initial offer
- **Aggressive ask**: 20-30% above initial offer (requires strong justification)

**When to be aggressive (20-30% ask)**:
- You have competing offers significantly higher
- Initial offer is below market rate
- You have rare, in-demand skills
- You're a passive candidate they really want

**When to be conservative (5-10% ask)**:
- Initial offer is already at or above market
- You're pivoting careers or industries
- You have limited leverage
- Company has rigid pay bands

**For other components**:
- **Signing bonuses**: Often easiest to negotiate ($10K-$30K+ increases common)
- **Equity**: Can negotiate 20-50% increases, especially at startups
- **PTO**: Typically 3-5 additional days is achievable
- **Benefits**: Usually non-negotiable (standardized across company)

### The Anchoring Effect

**Psychological principle**: The first number mentioned in a negotiation tends to anchor the discussion.

**Strategy**: If possible, let them make the first offer. But if you must go first, anchor high (but justified).

**Example**:
- Market rate: $130K-$150K
- Their likely offer: $135K
- Your ask if going first: $155K (top of range + buffer)
- Your ask if they offer $135K: $150K (split the difference strategy)

### How to Deliver Your Request

**Verbal delivery tips**:
- **Use confident tone**: Don't upspeak (rising inflection) which sounds uncertain
- **State it simply**: "I'm looking for $150,000." (Period. Not "I'm looking for $150,000?")
- **Don't apologize**: No "I'm sorry, but..." or "I know this might be a lot, but..."
- **Pause after**: Let them respond. Don't fill the silence.

**Written delivery tips**:
- **Be direct**: Don't bury your request in paragraphs of preamble
- **Use formatting**: Bold or highlight the specific number for clarity
- **Maintain professional tone**: Friendly but businesslike

**Example (Email)**:

Subject: Re: Offer Discussion

Hi [Name],

Thank you again for the offer. I'm very excited about the opportunity to join [Company] and contribute to [specific initiative].

I've had a chance to review the offer in detail and consider how it compares to market rates and my current compensation. Based on my research and the specific value I bring - particularly [brief value statement] - **I'm looking for a base salary of $150,000**.

I'm confident I can deliver [specific outcome] within my first 6 months, which would represent significant ROI on this investment.

I'm happy to discuss how we can structure a compensation package that works for both of us. Are you available for a call this week?

Best,
[Your name]

---

## COMPONENT 3: RANGE (The Flexibility)

### Why Ranges Matter

**The goal of negotiation**: Find a solution that works for both parties.

By providing a RANGE or flexibility in how your request could be met, you:
- Demonstrate you're collaborative, not demanding
- Give them multiple paths to say "yes"
- Show business acumen (understanding trade-offs)
- Increase probability of getting to your target total compensation

### Types of Range/Flexibility

**1. Structural Flexibility (Most Common)**
"I'm targeting $160K total compensation. We could structure this as:
- $160K base, OR
- $150K base + $10K signing bonus, OR
- $145K base + $15K signing bonus + additional equity"

**2. Time-Based Flexibility**
"I'm looking for $150K. If that's above the current band, I'd be open to:
- Starting at $145K with a 6-month review and adjustment to $150K based on performance, OR
- Starting at $145K with a guaranteed increase to $150K at the 1-year mark"

**3. Component Trade-Offs**
"My target is $200K total compensation. If there's limited flexibility on base salary, we could achieve this through:
- Higher equity grant
- Larger signing bonus
- Performance bonus guarantee
- Additional PTO
- Professional development budget"

**4. Geographic/Remote Flexibility**
"I'm looking for $155K for this role. I understand there may be geographic pay bands. I'm open to:
- Remote work with location-agnostic compensation
- Relocating to [higher COL area] if compensation reflects that market
- Hybrid arrangement that allows some location flexibility"

**5. Role/Scope Flexibility**
"Based on the scope we've discussed, I believe $170K is appropriate. Alternatively, if we expanded the role to include [additional responsibility], I'd be looking for $185K given the increased scope."

### The "If/Then" Structure

**Template**: "If [constraint] is an issue, then [alternative solution]."

**Examples**:

"**If** the base salary is fixed at $140K due to pay band limitations, **then** could we increase the signing bonus to $20K to bridge the gap?"

"**If** equity grants are standardized for this level, **then** would it be possible to structure a performance-based equity refresh after the first year?"

"**If** the total compensation budget is fixed, **then** I'd value additional PTO days (3-5 more) which would be meaningful to me without impacting the budget significantly."

### Presenting Multiple Scenarios

**The 3-Option Approach**:

Give them three paths - they're likely to choose the middle option (anchoring effect).

**Example**:

"I'm flexible on how we structure compensation to reach my target. Here are three scenarios that would work for me:

**Option A** (Preferred): $165K base + standard equity
**Option B**: $155K base + $15K signing bonus + 20% more equity
**Option C**: $150K base + $20K signing bonus + 30% more equity + 5 additional PTO days

Any of these would meet my requirements. What structure is most feasible for the company?"

### When NOT to Offer Flexibility

**Situation 1**: You have a true walk-away number with no flexibility
"I appreciate the offer, but my minimum requirement is $X total compensation. This is based on [reason]. I'm not flexible below this number, but I'm open to discussing how we structure it."

**Situation 2**: They're negotiating in bad faith (rare)
If they keep asking "What's the least you'd accept?" without justification, don't keep offering discounts.

**Situation 3**: Your first offer is already compromised
Don't give a range like "$140K-$160K" - they'll hear $140K. Give your target, then offer structural flexibility.

### Signaling Flexibility Without Weakness

**Weak approach**:
"I'll take whatever you can give me. I'm flexible!"
- Signals desperation

**Strong approach**:
"I'm looking for $160K. I'm flexible on **how** we get there - whether through base, bonus, equity, or other components - but that's my target total compensation."
- Signals confidence + collaboration

Subject: Re: Job Offer - Senior Software Engineer

Hi Sarah,

Thank you so much for extending the offer for the Senior Software Engineer position. I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to join the infrastructure team and contribute to the platform scaling challenges we discussed.

I've had a chance to review the offer details carefully. **[OPENING]**

**[REASON]** Based on my market research using Levels.fyi and conversations with peers at similar-stage companies, combined with my specific background - particularly my experience scaling infrastructure from 10M to 1B+ requests/day at [Previous Company] - I believe I bring significant value to this role. In our conversations, you mentioned the current platform is hitting scaling issues around 50M requests/day. I've solved exactly this problem before, which could save the team 6-12 months of trial and error.

**[REQUEST]** Given this, I'm looking for a base salary of $175,000, compared to the offered $155,000.

**[RANGE]** I'm flexible on how we structure this. Some options that would work:
- $175K base with the standard equity grant
- $165K base + $15K signing bonus + 20% increase in equity
- $160K base + $20K signing bonus + 30% increase in equity

**[CLOSING]** I'm confident we can find a structure that works for both of us. Are you available for a call this week to discuss?

Looking forward to continuing our conversation.

Best,
Alex

**Example 2: Verbal Negotiation (Phone Call)**

**Hiring Manager**: "We'd like to extend an offer of $140K base, 15% target bonus, and our standard equity package for this level."

**You**: "Thank you! I really appreciate that, and I'm excited about the opportunity. Before we finalize, can I share my thinking on compensation?"

**HM**: "Of course."

**You**: **[REASON]** "I've done research on market rates for this role, and I'm also currently evaluating another offer. More importantly, based on our conversations, I know you need someone who can [specific challenge], and I have direct experience doing exactly that at [Previous Company], where I [specific result]. I'm confident I can deliver [projected outcome] for your team within the first six months.

**[REQUEST]** Given that context, I'm looking for $165K base salary.

**[RANGE]** Now, I'm flexible on structure. If $165K base isn't possible, we could look at something like $155K base with a $15K signing bonus, or we could explore increasing the equity component. I'm open to discussing options.

**[CLOSING]** What are your thoughts? Is there flexibility in the offer?"

**HM**: "Let me see what I can do. The base might be challenging, but I think we can work on the signing bonus and equity."

**You**: "That sounds great. I appreciate you working with me on this. The most important thing for me is getting to a total compensation package of around $185K in year one. However we structure that - base, bonus, equity - I'm open to it."

---

**Example 3: Responding to "That's Above Our Budget"**

**Recruiter**: "I hear what you're saying, but $175K is above our approved budget for this role."

**You**: **[REASON - Reframe]** "I appreciate you being direct about the budget. Let me ask - is the challenge with the base salary specifically, or with total compensation?"

**Recruiter**: "The base salary band for this level maxes out at $160K."

**You**: **[REQUEST - Adjust]** "That's helpful context. In that case, if we're at $160K base, **[RANGE]** would you have flexibility to:
- Increase the signing bonus to bridge the gap? An additional $15K-$20K signing bonus would get us closer.
- Or increase the equity grant by 30-40%?
- Or a combination - $160K base, $10K additional signing bonus, and 20% more equity?

**[RE-REASON]** The reason I'm focused on this is based on my current total compensation and market rates. Any of those structures would work for me - I'm flexible on **how** we get there, but my target total comp is $190K for year one."

**[CLOSING]** Which of those options feels most feasible from your side?"

## ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: The "Reason Sandwich"

**Structure**:
1. REASON (Why you're valuable)
2. REQUEST (What you want)
3. REASON (Why it benefits them)

**Example**:
"Given my track record of reducing infrastructure costs by an average of $1.5M annually [REASON 1], I'm looking for $180K base compensation [REQUEST]. I'm confident I can achieve similar savings for your team within the first year, which would represent a 8-10x ROI on the incremental compensation investment [REASON 2]."

### Technique 2: The "Bracket and Narrow"

**Strategy**: Start with a range, then narrow to your target.

**Phase 1**: "Based on market research, this role seems to be in the $150K-$180K range."
**Phase 2**: "Given my specific experience with [unique value], I'm targeting the higher end of that range."
**Phase 3**: "Specifically, I'm looking for $175K."

**Why it works**: Feels less aggressive than starting with a single number, but you still end up at your target.

### Technique 3: The "Future Value" Request

**Strategy**: Tie your request to future value delivery, not just past performance.

**Example**:
"I'm requesting $170K base. Here's why I believe that investment makes sense: Based on the product roadmap we discussed, you're planning to launch [feature/product] in Q2. I've launched similar products three times, and each time we achieved [specific outcome]. If I can help you achieve even 50% of that result, it would represent approximately [calculated value]. That's the ROI lens I'm using to think about appropriate compensation."

### Technique 4: The "Competitive Transparency"

**Strategy**: Be transparent about competition without being threatening.

**Example**:
"I want to be transparent with you - I'm currently evaluating two other offers, one at $165K and another at $170K. I'm most excited about this opportunity because of [genuine reason], but compensation is a meaningful factor. If we could get to $175K, it would make this an easy decision for me."

**Why it works**: Shows you're in demand (scarcity) without ultimatums.

### Technique 5: The "Component Swap"

**Strategy**: Propose trading components you value less for components you value more.

**Example**:
"I noticed the offer includes a $10K relocation package, but I'm already local so I won't need that. Would it be possible to convert that into additional signing bonus or equity instead? That would be more valuable to me."

---

## COMMON NEGOTIATION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: First Offer Is Below Your Minimum

**Their offer**: $120K
**Your minimum**: $140K
**Gap**: $20K (17% increase needed)

**Your response using Reason-Request-Range**:

"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the role, but I need to be honest - there's a meaningful gap between this offer and what I'd need to make this move.

**[REASON]** My current total compensation is $135K, and based on market research for this role, I'm seeing ranges of $140K-$160K. Additionally, I'm currently evaluating another offer at $145K.

**[REQUEST]** For me to make this transition, I'd need a base salary of at least $145K.

**[RANGE]** I'm flexible on how we get there - if $145K base isn't feasible, we could look at $140K base with a $10K signing bonus and additional equity. But my minimum total comp requirement is $145K.

Is there flexibility in the offer to bridge this gap?"

### Scenario 2: You Have Multiple Offers

**Offer A**: $150K base, startup, higher risk
**Offer B**: $165K base, established company (preferred)

**Your response to Offer B**:

"I want to share that I'm currently weighing two opportunities. The other offer is $150K plus significant equity at an earlier-stage startup. While there's more risk there, the total comp potential is higher.

I'm more excited about this role because [genuine reasons], but I'd need the compensation to be competitive. **If we could get to $170K base** - which would represent a premium for the lower risk - **this becomes a clear choice for me**.

Alternatively, **if $165K is fixed, could we bridge with a $10K signing bonus and 25% more equity?**

What's possible?"

### Scenario 3: You're Pivoting Industries/Roles

**Situation**: Moving from corporate to startup, or changing functions
**Challenge**: Limited leverage due to career change

**Your response**:

**[REASON - Focus on Transferable Value]** "I understand I'm transitioning from [industry A] to [industry B], but I want to highlight how my background actually brings unique value here. In our conversations, you mentioned the challenge of [problem]. At [previous company], I solved a very similar challenge in a different context: [specific result]. That pattern-recognition and cross-industry perspective is something a traditional candidate wouldn't bring.

**[REQUEST]** Given that, I'm looking for $135K, which I know is toward the higher end of the range you mentioned.

**[RANGE]** If there's hesitation due to my industry transition, I'd be open to a performance-based structure: Start at $130K with a guaranteed review and adjustment to $140K after 6 months based on clearly defined milestones.

This way, you reduce risk, and I have the opportunity to prove the value I bring."

### Scenario 4: They Say "This Is Our Final Offer"

**Their statement**: "We really can't go higher. This is our final offer."

**Your response** (calm, professional):

"I appreciate you being direct about that. Can I ask a few questions to make sure I fully understand?

1. Is the constraint on base salary specifically, or on total compensation?
2. Are there other components we could adjust - signing bonus, equity, PTO, professional development budget - that might have more flexibility?
3. Is there a possibility of a structured increase after 6-12 months based on performance?

**[REASON]** The reason I'm exploring this is that there's still a gap of about $X between this offer and [my minimum/market rate/competing offer].

**[REQUEST/RANGE]** If the base truly can't move, I'd need to see **something** change - whether that's a $Y signing bonus, Z% more equity, or a commitment to review comp at the 6-month mark.

Without some adjustment, I'm going to struggle to accept this offer. What options do we have?"

---

## TIMING: WHEN TO USE THE FORMULA

### Optimal Timing for Your Request

**1. After they make the first offer**
- **Best practice**: Let them make the first move
- Then use Reason-Request-Range to counter

**2. When they ask "What are your compensation expectations?"**
- **Earlier in process**: Give a market-based range (broad)
- **Later in process/final stages**: Use the full formula

**3. In the written offer review**
- **Email response**: Use complete formula in writing
- **Follow up with call**: Discuss verbally as well

### Pacing Your Negotiation

**DON'T**: Make all your requests at once
"I need $20K more base, $15K signing bonus, 3 more PTO days, and remote work."
- Feels demanding
- Hard to say yes to everything

**DO**: Prioritize and sequence
**Round 1**: Focus on biggest item (usually base salary or total comp)
**Round 2**: Once that's addressed, discuss other components
**Round 3**: Final details (start date, PTO, etc.)

---

## PRACTICE EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Write Your Reason

**Instructions**: Craft 3 different REASON statements for a negotiation, using:
1. Market data + Value delivery
2. Competing offer + Unique skills
3. Total comp comparison + Scarcity

Compare them - which feels strongest?

### Exercise 2: Determine Your Request

**Scenario**: You've received an offer of $130K base. Market range is $125K-$150K. You have another offer at $140K.

**Questions**:
1. What should you request? (Specific number)
2. Why that number? (Reasoning)
3. What's your walk-away minimum?

### Exercise 3: Build Flexible Ranges

**Instructions**: You're targeting $160K total comp. The base offer is $140K. Create 3 different structural options that would get you to your target.

Example structure:
- Option A: ___________________
- Option B: ___________________
- Option C: ___________________

### Exercise 4: Role Play the Formula

**Instructions**: Script out a complete negotiation conversation using Reason-Request-Range.

**Setup**:
- Initial offer: $145K base, 15% bonus, standard equity
- Your target: $165K base
- Your leverage: Market data + unique skills
- Constraint: They say base is "at the top of the band"

**Write the dialogue** - both sides of the conversation.

## DELIVERY TIPS: VERBAL VS. WRITTEN

### When to Negotiate in Writing (Email)

**Use email when**:
- You need time to think and craft your response
- You want a paper trail of what was discussed
- You tend to get nervous or freeze in verbal conversations
- The offer was sent via email

**Email advantages**:
- Can carefully craft your Reason-Request-Range
- Can review and edit before sending
- Creates documentation
- Less pressure to respond immediately

**Email disadvantages**:
- No real-time back-and-forth
- Can come across as formal or distant
- Easier for them to say "no" without discussion

### When to Negotiate Verbally (Phone/Video)

**Use phone/video when**:
- You're comfortable thinking on your feet
- You want to build rapport and read reactions
- You need to have a dynamic, collaborative discussion
- They've called you to discuss the offer

**Verbal advantages**:
- Can adjust based on their reactions
- Can ask clarifying questions in real-time
- Builds relationship and rapport
- Harder for them to dismiss without discussion

**Verbal disadvantages**:
- Pressure to respond in the moment
- No "edit button" if you misspeak
- No paper trail unless you follow up in writing

### Best Practice: Combined Approach

**Optimal strategy**:

1. **Receive offer** (usually email)
2. **Send brief email response**: "Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about the opportunity. I'd like to review in detail and discuss. Are you available for a call on [day]?"
3. **Prepare your Reason-Request-Range** (write it out)
4. **Have verbal conversation** using your written notes
5. **Follow up via email** summarizing what was discussed and agreed

**Example follow-up email**:

"Hi [Name],

Thank you for the productive conversation today. To summarize what we discussed:

- I shared my target compensation of $165K base, based on [brief reason]
- You mentioned base salary has limited flexibility but there's room to increase the signing bonus and equity
- We agreed to explore: $155K base + $15K signing bonus + 25% equity increase

Please let me know if I've captured that correctly. I'm looking forward to reviewing a revised offer.

Thanks again for working with me on this.

Best,
[Name]"

**Why this works**:
- Creates paper trail
- Confirms mutual understanding
- Keeps negotiation moving forward
- Professional and collaborative tone

## VIDEO LESSON SCRIPT OUTLINE

**Introduction (0:00-2:00)**
"Here's the moment that terrifies most candidates: You've received a job offer, and you know you should negotiate... but you have no idea what to say.

Do you say 'I was hoping for more?' Do you throw out a number and hope they don't laugh? Do you just accept it to avoid the awkwardness?

In this lesson, I'm going to teach you the exact formula for making compensation requests that get taken seriously: The Reason-Request-Range Formula.

This is the same script structure that helped Marcus negotiate a $28,000 increase, and Emily get a counter-offer that beat her competing offer by $15K."

**Teaching the Formula (2:00-10:00)**
[Walk through each component with examples, showing both weak and strong approaches]

**Application (10:00-14:00)**
"Now let me show you this formula in action with a real scenario..."
[Demonstrate complete script, both email and verbal versions]

**Practice (14:00-15:30)**
"Your assignment is to write out your own Reason-Request-Range script using the template in the resources section. Then - and this is critical - record yourself delivering it verbally. Time it. It should take 2-3 minutes maximum.

Next lesson, we're going to cover what happens after you make your request - how to handle objections, negotiate back-and-forth, and close the deal."

## ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

**Knowledge Check (5 questions)**:

1. What is the correct order of the Reason-Request-Range formula?
   a) Request → Range → Reason
   b) Reason → Request → Range ✓
   c) Range → Reason → Request
   d) Request → Reason → Range

2. Which of these is a WEAK reason for higher compensation?
   a) "Market data shows this role pays $X-$Y"
   b) "I have another offer at $X"
   c) "I need more money to cover my bills" ✓
   d) "My track record shows I'll deliver X ROI"

3. What's the recommended increase to request when countering an initial offer?
   a) Always ask for exactly double
   b) 5-30% depending on leverage and market data ✓
   c) Never more than 5%
   d) Whatever your previous salary was plus 10%

4. What does "Range" mean in the Reason-Request-Range formula?
   a) Giving a salary range like "$140K-$160K"
   b) Asking them what their range is
   c) Offering structural flexibility in how you reach your target ✓
   d) Your historical salary range across jobs

5. When is the best time to use the Reason-Request-Range formula?
   a) In your first interview
   b) After receiving a formal offer ✓
   c) Before they've expressed interest in hiring you
   d) Only if they ask about your salary expectations

**Application Exercise**:

"You've received an offer of $135K base, 10% target bonus, and standard equity. Based on market research, similar roles pay $140K-$160K. You have another offer at $150K. Your current total comp is $145K.

Using the Reason-Request-Range formula, write:
1. Your complete email response (200-300 words)
2. A verbal script for a phone negotiation (2-3 minutes when read aloud)

Your response must include all three components clearly labeled."
