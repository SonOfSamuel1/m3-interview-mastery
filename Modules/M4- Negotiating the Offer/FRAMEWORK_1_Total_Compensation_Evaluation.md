# Framework 1: The Total Compensation Evaluation Framework

## Framework Overview

**Purpose**: Enable students to accurately evaluate job offers beyond base salary, calculating the true total compensation value to make informed decisions and identify negotiation opportunities.

**Problem It Solves**: 78% of candidates focus only on base salary, missing $15K-$40K in additional compensation elements that are often more negotiable than salary itself.

**Key Insight**: The "highest paying" offer isn't always the one with the biggest salary number.

## PILLAR 1: Base Salary

### What to Evaluate
- **Annual base salary** (pre-tax)
- **Salary payment frequency** (bi-weekly, monthly, semi-monthly)
- **Guaranteed increases** (annual COLA adjustments, merit increase policies)
- **Salary band positioning** (are you at bottom, middle, or top of range?)

### Evaluation Questions
1. How does this compare to market rate for this role? (Use Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Payscale)
2. What percentile does this put you in? (Aim for 65th-75th percentile minimum)
3. Is there room for salary growth within the band?
4. What's the guaranteed vs. performance-based split?

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- **High leverage**: When you're offered below market 50th percentile
- **Medium leverage**: When competing offers exist
- **Low leverage**: When at top of published band (focus on other pillars instead)

### Red Flags
- Salary significantly below market without other compelling compensation
- No clear salary increase policy
- Vague answers about salary bands or ranges
- Being placed at top of band with no growth room

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Pillar 1: Base Salary - Beyond the Big Number"

**Content**:
- Base salary is only 40-60% of total compensation in competitive offers
- Evaluate salary band positioning, not just the dollar amount
- Market research is non-negotiable: use 3+ data sources
- Consider: cost of living, tax implications, payment frequency
- **Key question**: "What's my growth trajectory within this salary band?"

**Visual**: Pie chart showing base salary as portion of total comp (40-60% segment highlighted)

---

## PILLAR 2: Bonus & Variable Compensation

### What to Evaluate
- **Signing bonus** (one-time payment, typically $5K-$50K+)
- **Annual performance bonus** (% of base salary, 10-30% typical)
- **Quarterly/monthly bonuses** (sales commissions, targets)
- **Retention bonuses** (paid after 1-2 years)
- **Guaranteed vs. performance-based split**

### Evaluation Questions
1. What percentage of employees actually receive their full bonus? (Ask this directly!)
2. How are performance targets set? (Realistic or "stretch goals"?)
3. Is the signing bonus subject to clawback? (If you leave within X months)
4. When is bonus paid? (Annually in March? Quarterly? Monthly?)
5. Is bonus discretionary or formula-based?

### Calculation Method
```
GUARANTEED BONUS VALUE = Signing bonus + (Annual bonus × probability of achievement)

Example:
- Signing bonus: $15,000
- Annual bonus: 20% of $120K base = $24,000 target
- Achievement probability: 80% (ask HR or current employees)
- Guaranteed value: $15,000 + ($24,000 × 0.8) = $34,200

Year 1 Total: Base $120K + Bonus $34,200 = $154,200
```

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- **Highest leverage**: Signing bonuses (one-time cost, easier for companies to approve)
- **Medium leverage**: Guaranteed first-year bonus (if you're starting mid-cycle)
- **Lower leverage**: Increasing bonus percentage (affects all employees at level)

### Red Flags
- Bonus targets that haven't been hit in 2+ years
- Discretionary bonuses with no clear criteria
- Clawback provisions exceeding 12 months
- Bonus percentage decreasing from previous role

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Pillar 2: Bonus & Variable Comp - The Hidden Negotiation Goldmine"

**Content**:
- Signing bonuses are often the MOST negotiable element (one-time cost)
- Always ask: "What percentage of employees hit their bonus targets?"
- Distinguish between guaranteed and "we hope you'll earn this" compensation
- Calculate discounted bonus value: Target × Historical achievement rate
- **Negotiation tip**: "Can we increase the signing bonus to $X to bridge the gap?"

**Visual**: Comparison table showing two offers - one with higher salary but lower bonus, another with lower salary but higher total comp when bonuses included

---

## PILLAR 3: Equity & Stock Compensation

### What to Evaluate
- **Stock options** (right to buy at strike price)
- **RSUs** (Restricted Stock Units - actual shares)
- **ESPP** (Employee Stock Purchase Plan - discounted buying)
- **Vesting schedule** (4-year with 1-year cliff is standard)
- **Acceleration clauses** (double-trigger, single-trigger on acquisition)

### Types of Equity Explained

**Stock Options (ISOs/NSOs)**:
- You receive the RIGHT to buy shares at a set price (strike price)
- Only valuable if company stock price > strike price
- Common in startups and pre-IPO companies
- Tax implications vary (ISOs vs NSOs)

**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)**:
- You receive actual shares of company stock
- Vests over time (typically 4 years)
- Taxed as income when vested
- Common in public companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.)

**ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan)**:
- Ability to buy company stock at 10-15% discount
- Often has 6-month purchase periods
- Can be significant benefit ($5K-$10K+ annual value)

### Evaluation Questions
1. What's the current valuation of the equity? (For private companies)
2. What percentage of the company do these shares represent?
3. What's the vesting schedule and cliff period?
4. Are there acceleration provisions if acquired?
5. What's the strike price vs. current fair market value?
6. Is there a secondary market to sell before IPO?
7. What's the company's path to liquidity? (IPO timeline, acquisition likelihood)

### Valuation Methodology

**For Public Company RSUs**:
```
Annual RSU Value = (Number of shares × Current stock price) ÷ Vesting years

Example:
- RSU Grant: 1,000 shares
- Current stock price: $180
- Vesting: 4 years
- Annual value: (1,000 × $180) ÷ 4 = $45,000/year

Year 1 Total Comp: Base $140K + RSU $45K = $185K
```

**For Private Company Options**:
```
Estimated Value = (Number of options × (Projected exit price - Strike price)) × Probability discount

Example:
- Options: 10,000
- Strike price: $5
- Projected exit: $25 (based on latest funding round)
- Probability discount: 30% (high risk startup)
- Estimated value: 10,000 × ($25 - $5) × 0.30 = $60,000 over 4 years = $15K/year
```

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- **High leverage**: Equity grants at startups (low cash cost to company)
- **Medium leverage**: RSU refresh grants for year 2+
- **Ask specifically**: "Can we increase the equity portion to match my previous total comp?"

### Red Flags
- Vesting schedule longer than 4 years
- No acceleration clauses
- Strike price equal to or near current valuation (options unlikely to be valuable)
- Private company with no clear path to liquidity
- Equity grant significantly below market for role/level

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Pillar 3: Equity - Decoding Stock Compensation"

**Content**:
- Equity can represent 30-50% of total comp at tech companies
- RSUs (public companies) vs. Options (private companies) - know the difference
- Standard vesting: 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Always ask: "What's the path to liquidity?" (IPO timeline, acquisition prospects)
- Discount private company equity by 50-70% when comparing offers
- **Key calculation**: Equity value ÷ vesting period = annual equity compensation

**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison of RSUs vs. Stock Options with example calculations

## PILLAR 4: Benefits & Insurance

### What to Evaluate
- **Health insurance** (medical, dental, vision)
- **Premium cost** (employer-paid percentage)
- **Deductible and out-of-pocket max**
- **HSA/FSA contributions** (employer matching)
- **Life insurance & disability**
- **Retirement benefits** (401k match, pension)

### Evaluation Questions
1. What percentage of health insurance premiums does the employer cover?
2. What's the annual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum?
3. What's the 401k match formula? (50% of 6%? 100% of 4%?)
4. Is there a vesting schedule for 401k match?
5. Do they offer HSA with employer contributions?
6. What's the life insurance and disability coverage?

### Monetary Value Calculation

```
Annual Benefits Value Calculation:

Health Insurance Savings:
- Family plan market rate: $24,000/year
- Your premium contribution: $3,000/year
- Employer covers: $21,000/year

401k Match:
- Your salary: $120,000
- Match formula: 100% of first 4%
- Annual match: $120K × 4% = $4,800

HSA Employer Contribution:
- Employer adds: $1,200/year

Total Annual Benefits Value: $21,000 + $4,800 + $1,200 = $27,000/year
```

### High-Value Benefits to Prioritize
- **401k match**: "Free money" - always max this out
- **HSA contributions**: Tax-advantaged savings
- **Premium-free health insurance**: Can save $15K-$25K/year for families
- **Parental leave**: 16+ weeks is exceptional
- **Professional development stipend**: $3K-$10K/year

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- **Lower leverage on benefits**: Usually standardized across company
- **Possible negotiation**: Professional development budget, home office stipend, relocation package
- **Alternative ask**: If benefits are weak, negotiate higher salary to compensate

### Red Flags
- High deductible plan with no HSA option
- No 401k match or vesting period exceeding 3 years
- Employee pays >30% of health premiums
- Benefits significantly worse than previous role

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Pillar 4: Benefits - The $20K-$40K Hidden Value"

**Content**:
- Premium health insurance can be worth $15K-$25K annually
- 401k match is "free money" - calculate the annual value
- HSA contributions are triple tax-advantaged
- Don't overlook: parental leave, professional development, commuter benefits
- **Calculate total benefits value**: Often $25K-$40K at competitive employers
- **Comparison tip**: Ask for "Total Rewards Statement" from both companies

**Visual**: Infographic breaking down typical benefits package value ($27K example)

## PILLAR 5: Time Off & Flexibility

### What to Evaluate
- **PTO/Vacation days** (15-25 days standard, unlimited policies)
- **Sick leave** (separate or combined with PTO?)
- **Holidays** (10-15 company holidays)
- **Parental leave** (maternity, paternity, adoption)
- **Sabbatical policies** (after X years)
- **Remote work flexibility** (full-time, hybrid, in-office)
- **Flexible hours** (core hours requirements?)

### Evaluation Questions
1. How many PTO days in year one? (Increases over time?)
2. Is PTO accrual-based or front-loaded?
3. What's the actual utilization rate? ("Unlimited PTO" often means less time off)
4. Can unused PTO be rolled over or paid out?
5. What's the parental leave policy?
6. What are the remote work expectations?
7. Are there core hours I must be online?

### Monetary Value Calculation

```
Time Off Value Calculation:

Method: Calculate the daily rate of your work

- Base salary: $120,000
- Working days per year: 260 (52 weeks × 5 days)
- Daily rate: $120,000 ÷ 260 = $461/day

Offer A: 15 PTO days
- Time off value: 15 × $461 = $6,915

Offer B: 25 PTO days
- Time off value: 25 × $461 = $11,525

Difference: $4,610 in annual value
```

### Quality of Life Value (Non-Monetary)

**Remote Work Flexibility**:
- Saves 1-3 hours/day in commute time
- Saves $3K-$8K/year in commuting costs
- Worth approximately $5K-$15K in salary equivalent

**Unlimited PTO Reality Check**:
- Studies show employees with "unlimited PTO" take 1-2 FEWER weeks than those with defined policies
- Ask: "What's the average PTO taken by employees on this team?"
- Red flag: Average is below 15 days despite "unlimited" policy

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- **Medium leverage**: Additional PTO days (usually can negotiate 3-5 more)
- **High leverage**: Remote work flexibility (if hybrid/in-office is standard)
- **Example ask**: "Can we start at 20 PTO days instead of 15, given my experience level?"

### Red Flags
- "Unlimited PTO" with culture of not taking time off
- PTO doesn't start accruing until after 90 days
- No rollover or payout of unused days
- Fewer than 15 days in year one
- Rigid return-to-office mandate when role could be remote

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Pillar 5: Time Off & Flexibility - The Lifestyle Value"

**Content**:
- Each additional PTO day = $400-$600 in annual value (based on daily rate)
- Remote work flexibility can be worth $10K-$20K in saved time and costs
- "Unlimited PTO" red flag: Ask "What's the team average PTO taken?"
- Quality of life has real economic value - quantify it
- **Negotiation tip**: PTO days are often easier to negotiate than salary
- **Calculate**: Your daily rate × Additional days off = Value to request

**Visual**: Comparison of two offers showing time-off value calculated

## PILLAR 6: Growth & Development Value

### What to Evaluate
- **Professional development budget** ($3K-$10K/year)
- **Conference attendance** (how many per year?)
- **Tuition reimbursement** (MBA, certifications)
- **Mentorship programs** (formal or informal)
- **Internal mobility** (cross-functional opportunities)
- **Promotion timeline** (typical time to next level)
- **Skills training** (workshops, courses, certifications)

### Evaluation Questions
1. What's the professional development budget?
2. How often do people at my level get promoted?
3. What's the typical career progression path?
4. Are there mentorship or sponsorship programs?
5. Does the company pay for conferences, certifications, or continuing education?
6. What learning resources are available? (LinkedIn Learning, O'Reilly, etc.)
7. Can I explore cross-functional projects?

### Monetary Value Calculation

```
Annual Growth Value Calculation:

Professional Development Budget: $5,000/year
Conference Attendance: $3,000/year (2 conferences)
Certifications Covered: $2,000/year
LinkedIn Learning Access: $400/year

Total Annual Growth Investment: $10,400/year

Long-term Career Value:
- Faster promotion trajectory = $15K-$30K salary jump 1-2 years earlier
- Skills acquisition = Higher earning potential over 5-10 years
- Network building = Access to better opportunities
```

### High-Impact Growth Opportunities
- **Tuition reimbursement**: MBA programs ($100K+ value over 2-3 years)
- **Executive coaching**: $5K-$15K/year value
- **Conference speaking opportunities**: Career accelerator
- **Cross-functional projects**: Exposure to leadership
- **Mentorship from executives**: Priceless for career trajectory

### Negotiation Leverage Points
- **Medium leverage**: Professional development budget increase
- **Ask specifically**: "Can we allocate $7,500 for professional development in year one?"
- **Alternative**: Negotiate for specific conference attendance or certification coverage

### Red Flags
- No formal professional development program
- No clear promotion criteria or timeline
- "We'll talk about development after you start" (vague)
- No investment in employee learning
- High turnover rate (suggests limited growth opportunities)

### Slide Content Recommendation

**Slide Title**: "Pillar 6: Growth Value - Your Career Trajectory Investment"

**Content**:
- Professional development budget averages $3K-$10K at top employers
- Faster promotion timeline = $20K-$40K in accelerated earnings
- Ask: "What's the typical promotion timeline for this level?"
- Tuition reimbursement for MBA = $100K+ value
- **Long-term value**: Skills and network built often exceed immediate salary
- **Negotiation opportunity**: PD budget is often negotiable when salary isn't

**Visual**: Timeline showing career trajectory with investment (promoted in 18 months) vs. without (promoted in 36 months), showing cumulative earnings difference

## FRAMEWORK APPLICATION: REAL EXAMPLE

### Case Study: Sarah's Two Offers

**Background**: Sarah, Senior Product Manager, has two offers to compare.

**Offer 1 - Startup**:
- Base: $140,000
- Signing bonus: $15,000
- Performance bonus: 15% target ($21,000)
- Stock options: 25,000 shares at $2 strike (company valued at $8/share)
- Health: Employee pays $200/month ($2,400/year)
- 401k match: 50% of 4% ($2,800)
- PTO: 20 days
- Remote: Fully remote
- Prof dev budget: $2,500

**Offer 2 - Enterprise**:
- Base: $155,000
- Signing bonus: $10,000
- Performance bonus: 20% target ($31,000), 90% achievement rate
- RSUs: $50,000/year over 4 years
- Health: 100% employer-paid (saving $6,000/year)
- 401k match: 100% of 6% ($9,300)
- PTO: 18 days
- Remote: Hybrid (3 days/week in office)
- Prof dev budget: $5,000

**Sarah's Evaluation Using the Framework**:

| Pillar | Startup (Offer 1) | Enterprise (Offer 2) | Winner |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Base Salary | $140,000 | $155,000 | Enterprise (+$15K) |
| Bonus | $15K sign + $16.8K annual* = $31,800 | $10K sign + $27.9K annual** = $37,900 | Enterprise (+$6.1K) |
| Equity | 25K options × ($8-$2) × 30% discount = $45,000/4yrs = $11,250/yr | $50,000/year | Enterprise (+$38.75K) |
| Benefits | $2,800 (401k) - $2,400 (premiums) = $400 | $9,300 (401k) + $6,000 (health) = $15,300 | Enterprise (+$14.9K) |
| Time Off | 20 days × $538/day = $10,760 | 18 days × $596/day = $10,728 | Startup (+$32) |
| Growth | $2,500 | $5,000 | Enterprise (+$2.5K) |
| Hidden Comp | Remote savings: $6,000 | Commuter: $3,360 | Startup (+$2.64K) |
| **YEAR 1 TOTAL** | **$210,710** | **$274,228** | **Enterprise +$63,518** |

*Bonus discounted to 80% achievement
**Bonus calculated at 90% achievement rate

**Sarah's Decision**:
Despite the startup's higher base salary appearing attractive initially, the Enterprise offer provides **$63,518 more in Year 1 total compensation** - a 30% higher package overall.

**Negotiation Strategy**:
Sarah uses this analysis to negotiate with the startup:
- "I'm very excited about your mission, but the total compensation gap is $63K when I include equity, benefits, and bonus. Can we increase the equity grant to 40,000 options and the signing bonus to $25,000 to bridge part of this gap?"

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR STUDENTS

### 1. Total Comp Can Differ by 30-50% from Base Salary
Never evaluate offers based solely on the salary number. Two offers with the same base salary can differ by $30K-$80K in total compensation.

### 2. The Framework Reveals Negotiation Opportunities
By breaking down each pillar, you can identify which components are:
- Below market (negotiate up)
- Most negotiable (focus here first)
- Non-negotiable (don't waste leverage)

### 3. Calculate Your Daily Rate
Your daily rate = Annual salary ÷ 260 working days

This helps you quantify the value of:
- Additional PTO days
- Remote work time savings
- Flexibility benefits

### 4. Discount Risky Compensation
- Startup equity: Discount by 50-70%
- "Target" bonuses: Multiply by realistic achievement % (usually 70-90%)
- "Unlimited PTO": Often means less time off - ask for team average

### 5. Request a Total Rewards Statement
Professional companies can provide a document showing your complete compensation package. If they don't have one, use this framework to create your own.

### 6. Use This Framework in Negotiation Conversations
"When I evaluate the total compensation using the 7 Pillars framework, there's a gap of $X compared to [market rate / other offer / my current compensation]. Can we address this by increasing [specific pillar]?"

## VIDEO LESSON SCRIPT OUTLINE

**Introduction (0:00-1:30)**
"You just received a job offer with a $120,000 salary. Congratulations! But here's the question that will determine whether you're leaving $30,000 on the table: Is $120,000 your actual compensation, or just one piece of it?

In this lesson, I'm going to show you the exact framework I use to evaluate job offers - the same framework my students have used to discover they were about to accept offers that were actually $40,000 LESS than competing offers, even though the salary was higher.

This is the Total Compensation Evaluation Framework, and it's going to change how you look at every job offer you receive for the rest of your career."

**Content (1:30-12:00)**
[Walk through each pillar with examples, showing calculations on screen]

**Application (12:00-14:30)**
[Live demonstration of filling out the worksheet with a sample offer]

**Conclusion (14:30-15:00)**
"Before this lesson, you probably evaluated offers based primarily on salary. Now you have a systematic framework to evaluate all seven pillars of compensation. Your action item: Download the Total Compensation Calculator and worksheet in the resources section.

Next lesson, we're going to learn how to research market rates for each of these components so you know whether you're being offered a competitive package - or whether there's room to negotiate up."
