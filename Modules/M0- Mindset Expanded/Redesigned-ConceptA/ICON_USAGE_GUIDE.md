## Customization Guide

### To Change an Icon Assignment

1. Open `generate_enhanced_slides.py`
2. Find the slide in `slides_data` array
3. Modify the icon parameter (last element in tuple)
4. Regenerate: `python generate_enhanced_slides.py`

Example:
```python
# Change slide 3 from 'target' to 'rocket'
("content", "The High-Ticket Job Search Mindset", [...], 3, "rocket")
```

### To Remove an Icon from a Slide

Set icon parameter to `None`:
```python
("content", "Title Here", [...], 5, None)
```

### To Add Multiple Icons to a Slide

Currently not supported, but could be implemented by:
1. Modifying slide creation functions to accept icon lists
2. Creating icon composition functions
3. Updating slide layout to accommodate multiple icons

## Icon Color Variations

All icons currently use the standard gold accent color: RGB(212, 175, 55) / #D4AF37

To create color variations:
```python
# In vector_graphics_pil.py
icon_img = create_icon('brain', size=80, color_rgb=(26, 31, 46))  # Navy version
icon_img = create_icon('target', size=80, color_rgb=(255, 255, 255))  # White version
```

## Best Practices

### Icon Selection Guidelines

1. **Conceptual Alignment**: Choose icons that metaphorically represent the slide content
2. **Visual Consistency**: Don't overuse the same icon in adjacent slides
3. **Strategic Emphasis**: Reserve certain icons (trophy, unlock) for key moments
4. **Balance**: Mix frequently-used and unique icons for visual variety

### Icon Sizing

- **Title Slides**: 120x120 pixels (centered, prominent)
- **Content Slide Headers**: 60x60 pixels (beside title)
- **Framework Slides**: 60x60 pixels (above columns)
- **Custom Layouts**: Adjust as needed for specific contexts

### When to Use No Icon

Use `None` when:
- Content is very text-heavy
- Slide concept is abstract and doesn't map to existing icons
- Visual simplicity enhances message clarity
- Creating intentional visual breathing room
