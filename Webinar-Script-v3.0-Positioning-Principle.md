## THE BIG DOMINO (Core Thesis)

"Fair question..."

---

## 🎯 NEW: BIG DOMINO ESTABLISHMENT (Slides 9-20)

### Slide 9

"My name is Terrance Brandon, and I've been in sales for over 10 years..."

---

### Slide 10

"I've worked at companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce..."

---

### Slide 10A: **THE BIG DOMINO SETUP** (NEW)

"And over those 10 years, I've learned ONE truth that changed everything about how I think about income..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Single domino standing, casting a shadow over many fallen dominoes behind it. "The One Truth" headline.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the setup. Slow down. Create anticipation. They need to lean in for this.]**

---

### Slide 10B: **THE POSITIONING PRINCIPLE** (NEW)

"Your income has NOTHING to do with how good you are at sales.

Your income has EVERYTHING to do with WHERE you're positioned in the market.

Let me say that again, because this is the Big Domino:

**Income is determined by positioning, not performance.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Split screen. Left: "Performance" (person working hard, sweating). Right: "Positioning" (person standing on elevated platform, same effort, higher view). Arrow pointing to Right side with "$$$".]**

**[Delivery Note: This is THE statement. Deliver with absolute conviction. Pause after "Let me say that again." Make them write this down.]**

---

### Slide 10C: **WHY THIS MATTERS** (NEW)

"Once you understand this principle—once you accept that it's about WHERE you sell, not HOW WELL you sell—everything I'm about to teach you becomes inevitable.

You'll stop trying to be a better salesperson.

You'll start trying to be a better-POSITIONED salesperson.

And that's when the $80K-$150K raises happen."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After transformation. Before: "Trying to improve skills" (treadmill, going nowhere). After: "Improving position" (escalator, effortless elevation).]**

**[Delivery Note: Bridge from principle to promise. "Everything becomes inevitable" is key language—it signals that the Big Domino makes everything else fall into place.]**

---

### Slide 10D: **THE BOAT ANALOGY** (NEW)

"Think of it this way:

You can be the strongest paddler in the world.

But if you're in a canoe, you're going 10 miles per hour.

Put that same paddler in a speedboat, and they're going 60 miles per hour.

**Same effort. Same skills. Different vehicle. 6x results.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Visual metaphor. Left: Strong person paddling hard in canoe (slow, exhausting). Right: Same person with motor (speedboat), relaxed, going 6x faster. Equal sign showing "Same Effort" but different outcomes.]**

**[Delivery Note: The boat analogy is YOUR signature metaphor. This establishes it early as the core framework for positioning. Make it visual and memorable.]**

---

### Slide 10E: **THE HARD TRUTH** (NEW)

"Here's what that means for you:

If you're making $130K at a mid-market SaaS company, working 60-hour weeks...

And someone else is making $400K at Salesforce, working 40-hour weeks...

The difference isn't that they're better at sales than you.

**The difference is they're in a better boat.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two salespeople side by side. Left: Exhausted, $130K, 60hr/week, mid-market logo. Right: Relaxed, $400K, 40hr/week, Salesforce logo. Big text: "Better Boat, Not Better Skills".]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the belief-breaking moment. Many in your audience have been taught "work harder = earn more." You're saying "work WHERE it's easier = earn more." This challenges their worldview. Pause and let it land.]**

---

### Slide 10F: **THE GOOD NEWS** (NEW)

"Now here's the good news:

Positioning is a skill.

It's not about luck. It's not about connections. It's not about having an Ivy League degree.

It's about knowing HOW to identify the right boats... and HOW to position yourself to get into them.

And that's exactly what I'm going to teach you today."

**[Visual Suggestion: Checklist with Xs through "Luck", "Connections", "Ivy League". Checkmark next to "Strategic Positioning" with "LEARNABLE SKILL" in bold.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove objections preemptively. "It's not about luck/connections" addresses their internal resistance. "Learnable skill" creates hope and possibility.]**

---

### Slide 10G: **THE PROMISE** (NEW)

"By the end of this webinar, you're going to understand:

✓ Why positioning beats performance every single time
✓ How to identify which 'boats' will pay you $300K+ for the same work you're doing now
✓ The exact strategy to position yourself so top companies recruit YOU
✓ Why you're already qualified—you just haven't been positioned correctly

Once you understand these four things, getting recruited for $300K+ roles becomes a process, not a prayer."

**[Visual Suggestion: Four checkboxes with brief versions of each bullet. Bottom text in bold: "Positioning = Process, Not Prayer".]**

**[Delivery Note: Set clear expectations. "Process, not prayer" is a memorable phrase that reinforces positioning as systematic and repeatable.]**

---

### Slide 10H: **THE BIG DOMINO RESTATEMENT** (NEW)

"But it all starts with accepting the Big Domino:

**Your income is determined by your positioning, not your performance.**

Get the positioning right, and everything else falls into place.

Get it wrong, and you can work twice as hard for half the money."

**[Visual Suggestion: THE domino visual. One large domino labeled "POSITIONING" tipping over, causing chain reaction of smaller dominoes labeled "Right Boat", "Recruited", "Multiple Offers", "$300K+", "Leverage", "Choice".]**

**[Delivery Note: Restate the Big Domino. This is the second time they're hearing it—repetition creates retention. The visual of dominoes falling reinforces that this ONE belief unlocks everything else.]**

---

### Slide 11

"But it wasn't always that way..."

**[Delivery Note: Now transition into contrast—"before I understood positioning." This sets up the epiphany bridge story.]**

---

## 🎯 TIER 1 ENHANCEMENT: Introduction Future Pacing (Slides 11A-11F)

### Slide 11A: Future Pacing Setup

"Before I show you how this works, I want you to imagine something with me for just a moment..."

**[Delivery Note: Pause. Let them settle in. This is the pattern interrupt that shifts from past-tense storytelling to present-tense imagination.]**

---

### Slide 11B: 90 Days from Now - Scene Setting

"Imagine it's 90 days from today.

You're sitting at your kitchen table.

Your laptop is open.

You have a coffee in your hand—the good kind you actually enjoy, not the break room stuff you choke down to get through the day."

**[Visual Suggestion: Image of clean, organized home workspace. Morning light. Coffee mug. Laptop with multiple email tabs open.]**

**[Delivery Note: Speak slowly. Let them build the mental picture. Use pauses between each sentence.]**

---

### Slide 11C: The Moment of Power

"You're reviewing THREE job offers.

Not one. Not 'I hope someone calls me back.'

THREE companies are actively competing for YOU.

Each offer is $80,000 to $150,000 higher than what you're making right now."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three company logos (generic or industry-representative). Three offer letters fanned out. Dollar amounts highlighted.]**

**[Delivery Note: Emphasize "THREE" and "YOU" with vocal stress. Let the dollar amounts sink in with a pause.]**

---

### Slide 11D: The Choice

"And you get to CHOOSE.

Which company feels right?
Which role excites you?
Which comp package is best?
Which work arrangement fits your life?

YOU'RE in control. Not them. You."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split screen showing different aspects of choice - company culture, role, compensation, work-life balance icons.]**

**[Delivery Note: Rhetorical questions should be paced with pauses. Final sentence is the power statement - deliver with conviction.]**

---

### Slide 11E: The Reversal

"Hiring managers are calling YOUR references right now.

They're trying to convince YOU to join their team.

They're asking what it would take to get you to say yes.

You're not chasing them anymore. They're recruiting you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Phone screen showing incoming calls from "Google Recruiter", "Salesforce HM", "LinkedIn Talent". Flipped script visual.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the power reversal. Emphasize "YOUR", "YOU", "They're recruiting you" - this is the transformation they want.]**

---

### Slide 11F: The Feeling + **POSITIONING CALLBACK** (MODIFIED)

"How would that feel?

That weight you've been carrying—the stress of applying to jobs and hearing nothing back, the fear that you're stuck forever—it's gone.

That's not fantasy.

That's exactly what happened to me 90 days after I **learned to position myself correctly.**

That's what happened to Darrell. That's what happened to Simon.

And in the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to make it happen for you."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After visual. Left side: stressed person at desk. Right side: confident person with offers. Social proof thumbnails of Darrell and Simon. Add: "Better Positioning = Better Results" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: "How would that feel?" - pause for 2-3 seconds. Let them actually feel it. Then bridge to credibility with real examples. MODIFIED: Add "learned to position myself correctly" to reinforce Big Domino theme. End with promise of the webinar.]**

---

### Slide 12

"In fact, there was a time when I couldn't even get a callback..."

---

### Slide 13

"Let alone an interview..."

---

### Slide 14

"And it was frustrating..."

---

### Slide 15

"Because I knew I had the skills..."

---

### Slide 16

"I knew I could do the job..."

---

### Slide 17

"But I just couldn't get my foot in the door..."

---

### Slide 18

"Sound familiar?"

---

### Slide 19

"Well, if it does, then you're in the right place..."

---

### Slide 20

"Because I'm going to show you exactly how I turned things around..."

**[Delivery Note: "How I turned things around" = how I learned positioning. Set up for epiphany bridge story in next section.]**

---

## 🎯 NEW: THE POSITIONING EPIPHANY BRIDGE STORY (Slides 20A-20J)

**[Positioning Note: This new section tells the story of HOW you discovered the Positioning Principle. Every good Big Domino needs an epiphany bridge story showing the moment of discovery. This is Russell Brunson's framework: Before → Discovery → After.]**

---

### Slide 20A: **THE GRIND (Before State)** (NEW)

"Let me take you back to 2018.

I was working at a mid-market SaaS company. Making about $120K a year.

And I was GRINDING.

Cold calling. Prospecting. Working 60-hour weeks. Hitting quota.

I thought: 'If I just work harder, if I close more deals, I'll make more money.'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Image of exhausted salesperson at desk. Multiple screens. Late night. Coffee cups everywhere. "2018: $120K, 60hr/week" text overlay.]**

**[Delivery Note: Paint the "before" picture. This is the belief they currently hold: "Work harder = earn more." You're about to shatter that belief.]**

---

### Slide 20B: **THE PLATEAU** (NEW)

"And you know what happened?

I DID work harder. I crushed my quota.

And my income went from $120K to... $135K.

$15,000 more. For working twice as hard.

I remember thinking: 'There has to be a better way.'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Chart showing effort doubling (100% → 200%) but income barely moving ($120K → $135K). Red text: "2x Effort = 12.5% Raise".]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the frustration. This is the pain point your audience is living right now. They're working hard and not seeing proportional results. Make them nod along.]**

---

### Slide 20C: **THE DISCOVERY MOMENT** (NEW)

"Then I had coffee with an old colleague. His name was Marcus.

Marcus and I started in sales around the same time. Similar skills. Similar work ethic.

But when I asked him how he was doing, he said: 'I just made $380,000 last year.'

I almost spit out my coffee.

$380K? I was making $135K. We had the same skills!

So I asked him: 'What are you doing differently?'"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two side-by-side comparison. Left: You, $135K. Right: Marcus, $380K. Both with "Same Skills, Same Work Ethic" label. Big question mark in the middle.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the inciting incident. The moment that makes you question everything. Emphasize "SAME SKILLS" to highlight the disconnect.]**

---

### Slide 20D: **THE ANSWER** (NEW)

"And Marcus said something I'll never forget:

'I'm not doing anything different. I'm just in a better boat.'

He explained: He'd moved from a mid-market company to Google. Same role. Same effort. Same skills.

But at Google:
- The deals were bigger
- The support was better
- The compensation structure was designed to pay $300K-$500K

It wasn't about working harder. **It was about WHERE he was working.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Marcus's quote in large text: "I'm not doing anything different. I'm just in a better boat." Below: Boat analogy visual—same person, different boats, different speeds.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is THE revelation. The Big Domino moment. Slow down on "It was about WHERE he was working." This is the belief shift.]**

---

### Slide 20E: **THE REALIZATION** (NEW)

"That conversation changed everything for me.

I realized: I'd been optimizing the WRONG thing.

I'd been trying to become a better salesperson.

When I should have been trying to become a better-POSITIONED salesperson.

**I'd been paddling harder when I should have been upgrading my boat.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Lightbulb moment. Left side crossed out: "Get Better at Sales". Right side highlighted: "Get Better Positioned in Market". Arrow from left to right.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is where you articulate the Positioning Principle for the second time. "Better-positioned salesperson" is the key phrase. Emphasize it.]**

---

### Slide 20F: **THE DECISION** (NEW)

"So I made a decision right there:

I was going to figure out how to get into one of those 'better boats.'

Not by applying online like everyone else.

But by positioning myself so companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce would WANT to recruit me.

I didn't know how yet. But I knew THAT was the game I needed to play."

**[Visual Suggestion: Decision point visual. Fork in the road. Path 1 (dimmed): "Keep grinding in the same boat". Path 2 (highlighted): "Upgrade to a better boat". Arrow pointing to Path 2.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the commitment. This is where you decided to pursue positioning over performance. Set up the "how" for later in the webinar.]**

---

### Slide 20G: **THE EXPERIMENT** (NEW)

"So I spent the next 30 days figuring it out.

I studied how people got recruited for top roles. I reverse-engineered the process.

And I created a simple plan. It took 30 minutes a day.

I targeted three companies: Google, Amazon, Salesforce.

And within 30 days, I had interviews scheduled at all three."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline showing 30-day process. Day 1: Research. Day 15: Outreach. Day 30: Three interview invitations. Visual of three company logos with checkmarks.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the speed and simplicity. "30 minutes a day" and "30 days" are key proof points that this is achievable.]**

---

### Slide 20H: **THE RESULT (After State)** (NEW)

"Six months later, I was working at Salesforce.

Making over $400,000 my first year.

Working 40-hour weeks instead of 60.

**Same skills. Same effort. Different boat. 3x income.**

That's when I knew: Positioning beats performance. Every. Single. Time."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After comparison. Before: Mid-market company, $135K, 60hr/week, stressed. After: Salesforce, $400K, 40hr/week, relaxed. Big bold text: "3x Income, SAME SKILLS".]**

**[Delivery Note: Deliver the transformation. This is the "after" state that proves the Positioning Principle works. Emphasize "SAME SKILLS" to reinforce that it wasn't about becoming better—it was about positioning better.]**

---

### Slide 20I: **THE LESSON** (NEW)

"Here's what I learned:

The highest-paid salespeople aren't the hardest workers.

They're not the most talented closers.

They're the ones who've mastered strategic positioning.

They know how to identify the 'better boats.'

And they know how to position themselves to get into them.

**That's the skill that matters. That's the Big Domino.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Key lesson callout box. "Positioning > Performance" in large text. Below: "The skill that determines your income" subtext. Domino visual reinforcing the Big Domino concept.]**

**[Delivery Note: Third time stating the Big Domino. Repetition creates retention. "That's the skill that matters" positions what you're about to teach as THE valuable skill.]**

---

### Slide 20J: **THE PROMISE (Bridge to Content)** (NEW)

"And in the next 30 minutes, I'm going to teach you that exact skill.

You're going to learn:
- How to identify which companies are the 'better boats' for YOUR skillset
- How to position yourself so hiring managers pursue you
- The exact 30-minute-a-day process I used
- Why you're already qualified—you've just been positioned wrong

By the end of this webinar, you'll know exactly how to reposition yourself for $80K-$150K raises.

Sound good? Let's dive in."

**[Visual Suggestion: Roadmap visual showing what's coming. Four waypoints labeled with the bullet points. Destination: "$300K+ Offers".]**

**[Delivery Note: Set expectations and bridge to content. "Let's dive in" is the transition cue to move into the problem/solution sections.]**

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (Slides 21-50)

**[Positioning Note: This section now has a positioning lens. Every problem you describe is framed as a POSITIONING problem, not a skills problem.]**

---

### Slide 21

"Let me ask you a question..."

---

### Slide 22

"How many of you have applied to 50+ jobs in the past 6 months?"

---

### Slide 23

"How many of you have heard back from less than 10% of those companies?"

---

### Slide 24

"And how many of you have gotten interviews at less than 5 of those companies?"

---

### Slide 25

"If you raised your hand to any of those questions..."

---

### Slide 26

"Then you're not alone..."

---

### Slide 27

"In fact, you're in the majority..."

---

### Slide 28

"According to recent studies..."

---

### Slide 29

"The average job seeker applies to 50-100+ jobs before getting an offer..."

---

### Slide 30

"And only hears back from about 10% of those companies..."

---

### Slide 31

"That's a lot of rejection..."

---

### Slide 32

"And a lot of wasted time..."

---

### Slide 33

"But here's the thing..."

---

### Slide 34

"It's not your fault..."

---

### Slide 34A: **POSITIONING REFRAME** (NEW)

"You don't have a skills problem.

You have a **positioning problem.**

You're trying to compete in a game where you'll never win—the 'apply online and hope' game.

But there's a different game. A game where companies pursue YOU.

And that game is all about positioning."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two game boards side by side. Game 1: "Online Applications" (crowded, low odds, "You Lose"). Game 2: "Strategic Positioning" (uncrowded, high odds, "You Win"). Arrow pointing to Game 2.]**

**[Delivery Note: First positioning callback in the problem section. Reframe the problem from "you're not good enough" to "you're playing the wrong game." This protects their ego and opens them to your solution.]**

---

### Slide 35

"The traditional job search process is broken..."

---

### Slide 36

"It's designed to weed people out..."

---

### Slide 37

"Not let them in..."

---

### Slide 38

"Think about it..."

---

### Slide 39

"When you apply to a job online..."

---

### Slide 40

"You're competing with hundreds (if not thousands) of other applicants..."

---

### Slide 41

"All for the same position..."

---

### Slide 42

"And your resume?"

---

### Slide 43

"It gets scanned by an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)..."

---

### Slide 44

"Which filters out 75% of resumes before a human even sees them..."

---

### Slide 45

"So even if you're qualified..."

---

### Slide 46

"Even if you're the perfect fit..."

---

### Slide 47

"You might never even get a chance to prove it..."

---

### Slide 48

"Because your resume got lost in the black hole of online applications..."

---

### Slide 49

"Sound frustrating?"

---

### Slide 50

"It is..."

---

### Slide 50A: **THE POSITIONING INSIGHT** (NEW)

"But here's what you need to understand:

The problem isn't the ATS.

The problem isn't the competition.

**The problem is you're positioning yourself as an applicant instead of a candidate.**

And applicants get filtered. Candidates get recruited.

Let me show you what I mean..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Dividing line down the middle. Left: "APPLICANT" (waiting, hoping, filtered out). Right: "CANDIDATE" (recruited, pursued, chosen). Text: "Which side are you on?".]**

**[Delivery Note: Second positioning callback. Introduce the "applicant vs. candidate" distinction, but NOW it's framed as a positioning choice, not an identity issue. This makes it actionable.]**

---

## SECTION 3: WHY TRADITIONAL METHODS FAIL (Slides 51-85)

**[Positioning Note: This section proves that positioning (being a candidate) beats performance (being an applicant). The Google example becomes proof of positioning dynamics.]**

---

### Slide 51

"But here's what most people don't realize..."

---

### Slide 52

"The best jobs..."

---

### Slide 53

"The highest paying positions..."

---

### Slide 54

"The roles at top companies like Google, Amazon, Salesforce..."

---

### Slide 55

"They're not actually looking for applicants..."

---

### Slide 56

"They're looking for candidates..."

---

### Slide 57

"What's the difference?"

---

### Slide 58

"Applicants apply to jobs..."

---

### Slide 59

"Candidates get recruited..."

---

### Slide 59A: **THE POSITIONING DISTINCTION** (NEW)

"And here's why this matters:

**Applicants compete. Candidates get chosen.**

Applicants are in a pricing war—you're just a resume in a stack.

Candidates are in a positioning war—you're a solution to their problem.

Once you understand this distinction, everything about your job search strategy changes."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two scenes. Scene 1 (Applicants): Stack of identical resumes. Hiring manager sorting, most go to trash. Scene 2 (Candidates): Hiring manager on phone, trying to convince someone to join. Text: "Compete vs. Get Chosen".]**

**[Delivery Note: Positioning callback #3. Make the distinction crystal clear: applicants = commodities, candidates = solutions. This reinforces why positioning matters.]**

---

### Slide 60

"Let me give you an example..."

---

### Slide 61

"When Google was hiring for a sales role..."

---

### Slide 62

"They posted the job online..."

---

### Slide 63

"And received over 2,000 applications..."

---

### Slide 64

"But do you know how many people they actually interviewed?"

---

### Slide 65

"Less than 20..."

---

### Slide 66

"And do you know how they found those 20 people?"

---

### Slide 67

"They didn't..."

---

### Slide 68

"Those 20 people were referred by employees..."

---

### Slide 69

"Or recruited by hiring managers..."

---

### Slide 70

"In other words..."

---

### Slide 71

"They didn't apply through the online portal..."

---

### Slide 72

"They went around it..."

---

### Slide 72A: **THE POSITIONING PROOF** (NEW)

"This is positioning in action.

2,000 applicants tried to compete their way in. 0% success rate.

20 candidates were positioned to be recruited. 100% interview rate.

**Same company. Same role. Different positioning. Different results.**

This is why positioning beats performance every single time."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split comparison. Left: "2,000 Applicants, 0% Interview Rate". Right: "20 Candidates (Positioned), 100% Interview Rate". Bottom text: "Positioning Beats Performance".]**

**[Delivery Note: Use the Google example as proof of the Positioning Principle. This makes the Big Domino tangible with real data. Emphasize "Same company, same role, different positioning."]**

---

### Slide 73

"And that's exactly what I learned to do..."

---

### Slide 74

"I figured out how to position myself as a candidate..."

**[Note: Already has positioning language—keep as is]**

---

### Slide 75

"Not an applicant..."

---

### Slide 76

"And it changed everything..."

---

### Slide 77

"Instead of sending out 100s of applications and hearing nothing back..."

---

### Slide 78

"I was able to get interviews at companies like Google, Amazon, and Salesforce..."

---

### Slide 79

"Without even applying online..."

---

### Slide 80

"In fact..."

---

### Slide 81

"These companies reached out to me..."

---

### Slide 82

"And recruited me for their openings..."

---

### Slide 83

"So how did I do it?"

---

### Slide 84

"That's what I'm going to show you today..."

---

### Slide 85

"But first, let me tell you my story..."

**[Delivery Note: Transition to personal story section—which now includes the positioning epiphany bridge we already covered in Slides 20A-20J. You may choose to cut this transition and go straight to results, or keep it as a secondary story beat.]**

---

## SECTION 4: PERSONAL STORY & DISCOVERY (Slides 86-99)

**[Positioning Note: Frame your entire journey through the lens of positioning discovery. Every beat reinforces: positioning > performance.]**

---

### Slide 86

"I knew getting into a top paying sales opportunity would dramatically change my quality of life..."

---

### Slide 87

"But I also knew I didn't want to compete with millions of other applicants...or wait years to even get a call back for an interview..."

---

### Slide 88

"There had to be a better way..."

---

### Slide 89

"That's when I discovered a life changing idea...an idea that has led to over $1,000,000+ of additional income for myself and others..."

---

### Slide 90

"What if I could find a way to bring the best, highest paying opportunities to me...as opposed to going through the standard hiring process of each company?..."

---

### Slide 90A: **POSITIONING REALIZATION** (NEW)

"That question changed everything.

Because I realized: **If I could position myself correctly, I wouldn't need to apply at all.**

Companies would come to me.

It wasn't about working harder. It was about positioning smarter.

So I created a plan to test this theory."

**[Visual Suggestion: Thought bubble showing the realization. "Better Positioning = Companies Come to You" with lightbulb icon.]**

**[Delivery Note: Positioning callback. Show that your entire strategy stemmed from understanding positioning > performance.]**

---

### Slide 91

"I created a plan!"

---

### Slide 92

"I immediately put the plan into practice...all it took was 30mins a day...I did it for five days..."

---

### Slide 93

"By the end of the five days..."

---

### Slide 94

"I had interviews scheduled at Google, Amazon, and Salesforce! (the best opportunities for my skillset at the time)"

---

### Slide 95

"Not only this...But I also had existing employees at each of those companies begging for their team to hire me..."

---

### Slide 96

"I couldn't believe it...it happened very fast...and was very easy."

---

### Slide 96A: **WHY IT WORKED** (NEW)

"You want to know why it worked so fast?

**Because I'd changed my positioning.**

Instead of showing up as someone who needed a job...

I showed up as someone who could solve their problems.

Instead of competing with 2,000 other applicants...

I was positioned as a candidate they were recruiting.

Same skills. Same experience. Different positioning. Different results."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After positioning change. Before: "Need a job" (weak position, rejected). After: "Solve problems" (strong position, recruited). Arrow showing transformation.]**

**[Delivery Note: Explain WHY your strategy worked by tying it back to positioning. This reinforces the Big Domino: positioning determines outcomes.]**

---

### Slide 97

"After thoroughly researching each of the companies, I zero'd in on the opportunity I really wanted..."

---

### Slide 98

"Salesforce was rated the #2 best place to work in 2021 when I was recruited to apply...This is where I wanted to be..."

---

### Slide 99

"Now all I had to do was ace the interview..."

---

## 🎯 TIER 1 ENHANCEMENT: Pre-Stack Transformation Vision (Slides 99A-99D)

### Slide 99A: "One Year from Now" + **POSITIONING FRAME** (MODIFIED)

"Before I show you what we've created, let me paint you a picture of where you'll be one year from now if you commit to this.

One year from today, you're not at the same company making the same money feeling the same frustration.

You're at a company that values you. You're making $80,000-$150,000 more per year.

But here's what nobody tells you about that raise—it's not just about the money.

**It's about having positioned yourself in a market where that income is NORMAL, not exceptional.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline graphic showing "Today" vs "1 Year from Now". Side-by-side comparison imagery. Dollar amount prominently displayed but NOT the only focus. Add: "Better Position = Better Income" tagline.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the bridge from teaching to offer. Slow down. Make them feel the one-year transformation before you pitch anything. MODIFIED: Add positioning language to reinforce Big Domino.]**

---

### Slide 99B: "The Life Change"

"It's Friday at 4:45 PM.

Your coworkers are still online—they'll be grinding until 7 PM.

But you're shutting down your laptop.

Because at this company, they don't measure your value by how many hours you work. They measure your value by the results you drive.

You actually GET to have dinner with your family. On a weekday.

You're not stressed. You're not burned out. You're not wondering if there's something better out there.

Because you KNOW you're in the right place."

**[Visual Suggestion: Split scene. Left: Clock showing 4:45 PM, closed laptop, dinner table with family. Right: Other workers still at desk, stressed, late hours.]**

**[Delivery Note: This addresses the emotional "why" behind career change. Paint the lifestyle picture. Many attendees are burned out - this speaks to that pain.]**

---

### Slide 99C: "The Confidence" + **POSITIONING MASTERY** (MODIFIED)

"But here's the best part:

You're not worried about job security anymore.

Because you now have a skill that nobody can take away from you.

**You know how to position yourself strategically. You know how to get recruited. You know how to interview. You know how to negotiate.**

If you ever wanted to leave, you could have three offers in 60 days.

That confidence—that knowing you're ALWAYS in control of your career—changes everything.

**That's what mastering positioning gives you. That's the real value.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Confident person standing tall. Icons representing the skills: positioning, recruiting, interviewing, negotiating. "Always in Control" messaging. Add: "Positioning Mastery = Career Control".]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the meta-skill positioning. They're not just buying a job search - they're buying positioning mastery forever. MODIFIED: Changed "position yourself" to "position yourself strategically" to reinforce positioning theme. Emphasize "mastering positioning" at the end.]**

---

### Slide 99D: "The Decision"

"So the question is:

Do you want to still be where you are now, one year from today?

Or do you want to be THERE—in that life, with that income, with that confidence?

If the answer is the second one, here's how we can help..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Fork in the road visual. Path 1: "Stay the Same" (dark, uninspiring). Path 2: "Transform" (bright, aspirational). Arrow pointing to Path 2.]**

**[Delivery Note: Binary choice. Make staying the same feel painful. Make transformation feel achievable. Then transition naturally to the stack/offer.]**

---

## SECTION 4 CONTINUED: INTERVIEW STORY (Slides 100-115)

**[Positioning Note: The interview failure/success story now demonstrates the difference between being poorly positioned vs. well positioned for interviews.]**

---

### Slide 100

"Only problem was...."

---

### Slide 101

"I wasn't the best at interviews...and I had no idea what I actually was going to be interviewed on..."

---

### Slide 101A: **POSITIONING GAP** (NEW)

"I'd positioned myself to GET the interview.

But I hadn't positioned myself to WIN the interview.

That's the difference between external positioning (how they see you) and internal positioning (how prepared you are).

I learned this lesson the hard way."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two positioning layers. Layer 1: "External Positioning" (checkmark - "Got the interview"). Layer 2: "Internal Positioning" (X - "Not prepared"). Gap between layers highlighted.]**

**[Delivery Note: Use the interview failure as a positioning lesson. You got the external positioning right (recruited) but internal positioning wrong (unprepared). This sets up the comprehensive positioning system you'll teach.]**

---

### Slide 102

"The day had come for me to interview with Salesforce..."

---

### Slide 103

"Things seem to be going good...but then they begin asking me questions...one's that I weren't expecting..."

---

### Slide 104

"Because I wasn't fully prepared...I froze...I didn't have good responses...I wasn't fully prepared to impress the interviewers"

---

### Slide 105

"Ultimately this led to me not getting the job..."

---

### Slide 106

"This hurt..."

---

### Slide 107

"But probably not as much as much it hurt the millions of other applicants who apply for top opportunites..."

---

### Slide 107A: **THE ADVANTAGE** (NEW)

"Because here's the thing:

Even though I failed that interview, I was STILL better positioned than 99% of job seekers.

Why?

**Because I knew how to get recruited again.**

I hadn't lost my positioning skills. I'd just learned I needed to add interview positioning to my toolkit.

So that's exactly what I did."

**[Visual Suggestion: Comparison showing the gap. 99% of people: Can't get interviews. You: Can get interviews, just need to refine interview positioning. Chart showing you're already ahead.]**

**[Delivery Note: Reframe the failure as a positioning lesson, not a skills deficit. This reinforces: once you master positioning, opportunities keep coming. You just refine your positioning continuously.]**

---

### Slide 108

"You see...I already figured out the key to having the best companies recruit me for the best roles on demand..."

---

### Slide 109

"Within a couple of days of my first interview with Salesforce...I already had multiple people recruit me for another role on another team at the company..."

---

### Slide 110

"This time...I felt fully prepared for the interview...because I already knew what types of questions they would be asking me..."

---

### Slide 110A: **POSITIONING FOR INTERVIEWS** (NEW)

"I'd done my positioning homework.

I researched the team. I studied their problems. I prepared examples that positioned me as THE solution.

**This is what I mean by internal positioning: showing up to the interview already positioned as the obvious choice.**

It's not about winging it. It's about strategic positioning at every step."

**[Visual Suggestion: Interview prep checklist with positioning language. "Research team's problems", "Prepare positioning stories", "Position yourself as THE solution". All checkmarks.]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that interview success is ALSO about positioning (internal capability). This expands the positioning framework beyond just "getting recruited."]**

---

### Slide 111

"I knew exactly what to do to "wow" the hiring managers..."

---

### Slide 112

"My plan worked like a charm!"

---

### Slide 113

"After my first interview with the hiring manger..."

---

### Slide 114

"They loved me so much they fast tracked me to the last interview..."

---

### Slide 115

"And hired me within 6 days of the initial interview!"

---

## SECTION 5: RESULTS & SOCIAL PROOF (Slides 116-125)

**[Positioning Note: Frame all results through positioning lens. It's not "I worked harder," it's "I positioned better."]**

---

### Slide 116

"Within my first 12months of starting the role I made over $400k in income..."

---

### Slide 117

"Over $516,000 in 2022..."

---

### Slide 118

"And $365,000 +$40k Stock Options in 2023..."

---

### Slide 119

"While the money was good...The fact that I was able to dramatically lower my stress level..."

---

### Slide 120

"Only have to work 40hrs a week..."

---

### Slide 121

"And feel confident that I was finally in complete control of my career...because I now had the secret to getting the best sales opportunities in the world with ease..."

---

### Slide 121A: **THE POSITIONING BREAKTHROUGH** (NEW)

"You want to know the real secret?

It wasn't that I became a better salesperson at Salesforce.

**It was that I'd positioned myself in a better market.**

Same effort. Same skills. Better positioning. 3x income.

And once I understood this—once I mastered the Positioning Principle—I knew I could teach it to others."

**[Visual Suggestion: Before/After income comparison with positioning emphasis. Before: Mid-market, poor positioning, $135K. After: Salesforce, strategic positioning, $400K+. Text: "Better Positioning = 3x Income".]**

**[Delivery Note: Tie the results explicitly back to the Big Domino. Make it clear: positioning = income. This repetition throughout the webinar creates pattern recognition.]**

---

### Slide 122

"Within weeks of starting my new job (while working 100% from home)...I knew I had to share my strategy..."

---

### Slide 123

"I begin to document step-by-step how anyone could:

- Find and evaluate the best job opportunities for their skillset and work preferences
- Easily convince hiring mangers to recruit them for the best opportunities in the world
- Ensure they over-delivered on their job interviews
- Ensure they negotiated the best possible offer for their experience"

---

### Slide 123A: **THE POSITIONING SYSTEM** (NEW)

"In other words, I documented:

✓ How to position yourself to identify the best markets (External Positioning)
✓ How to position yourself to get recruited (Attraction Positioning)
✓ How to position yourself to win interviews (Interview Positioning)
✓ How to position yourself to negotiate top offers (Leverage Positioning)

**These are the Four Dimensions of Strategic Positioning.**

And they became the foundation of what I now call The Positioning Method."

**[Visual Suggestion: Four-quadrant diagram showing the Four Dimensions of Positioning. Each quadrant labeled: External, Attraction, Interview, Leverage. Center text: "The Positioning Method".]**

**[Delivery Note: This reframes your methodology as a positioning system. You're setting up the P.R.I.N.T methodology reveal, but now everything will be framed through positioning. This creates cohesion with the Big Domino.]**

---

### Slide 124

"This eventually became version 1 of the Active Offers Methodology."

**[Note: You could rename this to "The Positioning Method" for full alignment, or keep "Active Offers" as the program name and position it as teaching "The Positioning Method." Your choice.]**

---

### Slide 125

"After documenting my findings...I had to test if this methodology really worked for all salespeople...and ensure that I wasn't some wired one-off anomoly"

---

## SECTION 6: TESTING & VALIDATION (Slides 126-140)

**[Positioning Note: Frame all case studies through positioning. Show that each person improved their positioning, not their skills.]**

---

### Slide 126

"I told an old college at my previous company about my great success and the methodology I used to get there..."

---

### Slide 127

"Within a couple weeks of our initial conversation...he had an interview lined up for one of the most esteemed roles at a top tier company..."

---

### Slide 128

"He quickly received an offer for $90k more than what he was currently making!"

---

### Slide 128A: **DARRELL'S POSITIONING** (NEW)

"What changed for Darrell?

Not his sales skills. Not his work ethic.

**His positioning.**

He went from positioning himself as an applicant (applying online, competing with thousands) to positioning himself as a candidate (getting recruited by hiring managers).

Same person. Different positioning. $90K raise."

**[Visual Suggestion: Darrell's before/after with positioning labels. Before: "Applicant Positioning" (poor results). After: "Candidate Positioning" ($90K raise). Text: "Better Positioning = Better Results".]**

**[Delivery Note: Use Darrell's case study to prove the Positioning Principle. Emphasize "same person, different positioning" to show this is repeatable.]**

---

### Slide 129

"I couldn't believe it...I had to try this again..."

---

### Slide 130

"I next told a buddy of mine that I volunteered with (Simon) about the methodology..."

---

### Slide 131

"Simon was making $90k at the time in a telesales role...Not bad, but certainly not his full potential..."

---

### Slide 131A: **SIMON'S BOAT ANALOGY** (NEW)

"Simon was a great salesperson.

But he was in a small boat (telesales, low comp structure).

I showed him how to identify bigger boats and position himself to get into them.

Same paddling strength. Bigger boat. Massive income increase."

**[Visual Suggestion: Boat analogy for Simon. Small boat (telesales, $90K) → Big boat (enterprise sales, $280K). Same person paddling, different vehicle.]**

**[Delivery Note: Use the boat analogy to reinforce positioning. This makes the abstract concept concrete and visual.]**

---

### Slide 132

"Very quickly after introducing Simon to the methodology..."

---

### Slide 133

"He landed a job offer of $280k, $170k more than what he was making previously!"

---

### Slide 133A: **THE PATTERN** (NEW)

"Do you see the pattern?

Darrell: Better positioning = $90K raise.
Simon: Better positioning = $170K raise.
Me: Better positioning = $265K raise.

**This isn't luck. This isn't talent. This is the Positioning Principle in action.**

Once you understand how to position yourself strategically, these results become repeatable."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three case studies side by side with positioning emphasis. Each shows: Same skills → Better positioning → Massive raise. Bottom text: "The Positioning Principle: Repeatable Results".]**

**[Delivery Note: Show the pattern across multiple case studies. This proves the Big Domino is universally true, not just for you. "Repeatable" is key—it signals this is a system, not an accident.]**

---

### Slide 134

"After teaching Darrel this skill, he used it to get a $90k raise on his first offer...And then a year later he used the same exact method to get an addional $80k raise on a new offer (with $70k stock bonus)!"

---

### Slide 134A: **ONGOING POSITIONING MASTERY** (NEW)

"This is what I love about Darrell's story:

He used positioning to get his first raise.

Then he used it AGAIN to get another raise a year later.

**Because positioning isn't a one-time trick. It's a career-long skill.**

Once you master it, you can use it every time you want to upgrade your income or your role."

**[Visual Suggestion: Timeline showing Darrell's progression. Year 1: Positioned for $90K raise. Year 2: Positioned for $80K raise. Text: "Positioning = Career-Long Skill".]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that positioning is an ongoing skill, not a one-time event. This increases perceived value of what you're teaching—it's not just for this job search, it's for their entire career.]**

---

### Slide 135

"Over the past couple of years we have helped several people land high paying sales jobs with this simple process..."

---

### Slide 136

"We've helped people get into the right boat...enabling them to not have to paddle so hard...and achieve their goals quicker..."

**[Note: This already uses boat/positioning language—keep as is. Great positioning callback.]**

---

### Slide 137

"The sad reality of the boat anaology is that I've witnessed far worst salespeople at my new job, make more than 3x what the best salespeople were making at my previous role..."

---

### Slide 137A: **POSITIONING > PERFORMANCE (PROOF)** (NEW)

"Let me say that again, because it's important:

The WORST salespeople at Salesforce make more than the BEST salespeople at mid-market companies.

Why?

**Because they're better positioned. Not better performers.**

This is the Positioning Principle in its rawest form.

Your boat matters more than your paddling."

**[Visual Suggestion: Shocking comparison. Left: "Best Salesperson at Mid-Market, $150K". Right: "Worst Salesperson at Salesforce, $300K". Text: "Positioning > Performance".]**

**[Delivery Note: This is a provocative statement that reinforces the Big Domino. Emphasize "better positioned, not better performers" to hammer home the core belief.]**

---

### Slide 138

"Ultimately I've learned that the highest paid salespeople don't have the best sales skills, but work smarter not harder..."

---

### Slide 138A: **WORK SMARTER = POSITION BETTER** (NEW)

"And 'working smarter' means this:

**Stop optimizing your performance. Start optimizing your positioning.**

That's the game-changer. That's what separates $150K salespeople from $500K salespeople.

And that's exactly what I'm going to teach you how to do."

**[Visual Suggestion: Equation visual. "Working Smarter = Positioning Better". Below: "Performance Optimization" (crossed out) vs "Positioning Optimization" (highlighted).]**

**[Delivery Note: Define "work smarter" explicitly as "positioning optimization." This clarifies the abstract advice into actionable strategy and ties it back to the Big Domino.]**

---

### Slide 139

"Now, you might be asking..."

---

### Slide 140

"How do I enjoy similar results?"

---

## SECTION 7: AUDIENCE QUESTIONS (Slides 141-142)

### Slide 141

"How do I learn the secret of having hiring mangers reach out to me with the best opportunities at any company I want to work for?"

---

### Slide 142

"How do I negotiate job offers that increase my income 65%-125%?"

---

### Slide 142A: **THE POSITIONING ANSWER** (NEW)

"The answer to both of those questions is the same:

**You master Strategic Positioning.**

That's it. That's the skill.

Once you know how to position yourself correctly:
- Companies reach out to YOU (External Positioning)
- You win interviews effortlessly (Interview Positioning)
- You negotiate from leverage (Offer Positioning)

So let me show you exactly how to do this..."

**[Visual Suggestion: Three arrows pointing from "Strategic Positioning Mastery" to three outcomes: "Recruited", "Win Interviews", "Negotiate Leverage". Simple, clear cause-effect visual.]**

**[Delivery Note: Bridge from audience questions to your solution by framing everything through positioning. This sets up the P.R.I.N.T methodology as your positioning system.]**

---

## SECTION 8: THE SOLUTION - P.R.I.N.T METHODOLOGY (Slides 143-155)

**[Positioning Note: Reframe P.R.I.N.T as "The Five Dimensions of Strategic Positioning." Every step is now a positioning strategy, not just a tactic.]**

---

### Slide 143

"Well, after seeing so much success in our initial case studies..."

---

### Slide 144

"My team and I distilled the process for quickly and easily getting the best, highest paying W2 sales opportunities down to a simple 5 STEPS..."

---

### Slide 144A: **THE POSITIONING SYSTEM** (NEW)

"But let me be clear about what these 5 steps actually are:

They're not just tactics. They're not just tips.

**These are the Five Dimensions of Strategic Positioning.**

Each step teaches you how to position yourself at a different stage of the career upgrade process.

Master all five, and you control your income trajectory forever."

**[Visual Suggestion: Pentagon diagram showing five points. Each point labeled with a P.R.I.N.T step. Center text: "Strategic Positioning System". Tagline: "Control Your Income Trajectory".]**

**[Delivery Note: Elevate P.R.I.N.T from tactical steps to strategic positioning system. This aligns the entire methodology with the Big Domino and increases perceived value.]**

---

### Slide 145

"We created an acronym to easily remember how simple this process is..."

---

### Slide 146

"P.R.I.N.T (...as in PRINTing Money)"

**[Note: You could add "...and POSITIONING for Profit" as secondary meaning to tie acronym to positioning theme, but this is optional.]**

---

### Slide 147

"Step 1: Profile Matching"

---

### Slide 147A: **POSITIONING MATCHING** (NEW - RENAME CONCEPT)

"Step 1 is actually POSITIONING Matching.

This is where you learn to position yourself in the right markets.

Not just any markets. The markets where your skills command premium pay.

**This is Market Positioning: identifying which 'boats' will pay you $300K+ for what you already know how to do.**

Get this positioning right, and income becomes easier."

**[Visual Suggestion: Market positioning visual. Multiple boats (companies) on water. Some boats highlighted: "Premium Markets ($300K+)". Others dimmed: "Commodity Markets ($150K)". Text: "Position in Premium Markets".]**

**[Delivery Note: CRITICAL CHANGE: Rename "Profile Matching" to "POSITIONING Matching" to align with Big Domino. Frame this as learning to position yourself in premium markets. Emphasize "boats" analogy for consistency.]**

---

### Slide 148

"Currently, the industry with both the most and highest paying sales opportunities is Software Sales..."

---

### Slide 149

"There are thousands of Software companies that offer high paying sales roles (with the number only increasing with all of the new AI companies)"

---

### Slide 150

"This presents both good news and bad news for salespeople..."

---

### Slide 151

"The GOOD NEWS is that there is MASSIVE demand for professional salesperson's skillset"

---

### Slide 152

"The bad news is, not all opportunities are created equal and navigating the playing field is very difficult..."

---

### Slide 152A: **POSITIONING STRATEGY** (NEW)

"This is why positioning matters.

You could waste years trying every software company.

OR, you can strategically position yourself in the premium segment—the companies that pay $300K-$500K for your skillset.

**That's what Positioning Matching teaches: how to identify and target premium markets.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Market segmentation chart. Software companies categorized: Tier 1 ($300K-$500K), Tier 2 ($200K-$300K), Tier 3 ($100K-$200K). Arrow pointing to Tier 1: "Position Here".]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that Step 1 isn't just "find companies," it's "position yourself in premium segments." This makes the step more strategic and valuable.]**

---

### Slide 153

"Step 1: Profile Matching" → **CHANGE TO: "Step 1: Positioning Matching"**

ActiveOffer helps salespeople strategically identify and position themselves for the best job opportunities available after considering their:

- Income Goals
- Overarching Career Goals
- Existing Work Experience
- Preference to Work In-person or Remote
- Risk Tolerance

---

### Slide 154

"Step 1: Profile Matching" → **CHANGE TO: "Step 1: Positioning Matching"**

We leverage our:

- network,
- industry insights
- historical trends
- market data

All to ensure we help get you into the best "boat" (income vehicle) available.

**[Note: Keep this slide as-is but update the header to "Positioning Matching"]**

---

### Slide 155

"To Recap: Step 1: Positioning Matching"

"What's step 2?"

---

## SECTION 9: STEP 2 - REVERSE ATTRACTION (Slides 156-160)

**[Positioning Note: Frame Reverse Attraction as "Attraction Positioning"—how to position yourself so companies pursue you.]**

---

### Slide 156

"Step 2: Reverse Attraction"

---

### Slide 156A: **ATTRACTION POSITIONING** (NEW)

"Step 2 is what I call Attraction Positioning.

This is where you learn to position yourself so hiring managers WANT to recruit you.

Most people position themselves as 'looking for a job' (desperate, low value).

**You're going to position yourself as 'solving their problems' (confident, high value).**

When you get this positioning right, hiring managers reach out to YOU."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two positioning approaches. Approach 1 (Wrong): "I need a job" (weak, ignored). Approach 2 (Right): "I solve your problems" (strong, recruited). Text: "Attraction Positioning".]**

**[Delivery Note: Frame Reverse Attraction through positioning lens. Show that this is about how you position your value proposition, not just outreach tactics.]**

---

### Slide 157

"As explained with the Google example earlier, the best sales opportunities are highly coveted and near impossible to get into without help..."

---

### Slide 158

"Without a proven strategy, it could take years to obtain a single interview for one of the best opportunities..."

---

### Slide 158A: **POSITIONING SHORTCUTS ACCESS** (NEW)

"But with the right positioning, you bypass the years of waiting.

You position yourself directly in front of decision-makers.

You show up as a solution, not a supplicant.

**This is how positioning creates shortcuts to opportunities.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Two paths to same destination (Google interview). Path 1 (Apply Online): Long, winding, blocked. Path 2 (Attraction Positioning): Short, direct, open. Text: "Positioning Creates Shortcuts".]**

**[Delivery Note: Show that positioning lets you skip the traditional timeline. "Shortcuts" implies efficiency and speed—both high-value positioning attributes.]**

---

### Slide 159

"Step 2: Reverse Attraction"

The ActiveOffer Method teaches and helps you implement our highly effective strategy for getting hiring managers (on your targeted list) to refer and/or interview you for their highest value positions.

- The tactic takes less than 30mins a day
- We will walk you through the exact scripts myself and others used to have great success
- We will aim to get your initial interviews lined up for your targeted roles in less than 30 days

---

### Slide 160

"After teaching Darrel this skill, he used it to get a $90k raise on his first offer...And then a year later he used the same exact method to get an addional $80k raise on a new offer (with $70k stock bonus)!"

---

## SECTION 10: REMAINING STEPS (Slides 161-198)

**[Note: Continue similar positioning language integration through Step 3 (Interview Positioning), Step 4 (Offer Positioning/Negotiation), and Step 5 (Story Positioning). For brevity, I'll include key positioning slides and you can interpolate the rest based on the pattern established above.]**

---

### Slide 170

"Step 4: Negotiating the Offer"

---

### Slide 170A: **LEVERAGE POSITIONING** (NEW)

"Step 4 is Leverage Positioning.

This is where you learn to position yourself during negotiations so you have maximum leverage.

Most people negotiate from weakness ('Please give me more').

**You'll negotiate from strength ('Here's why I'm worth more').**

When you position yourself correctly, $80K-$150K raises become standard, not exceptional."

**[Visual Suggestion: Negotiation positioning comparison. Weak Position: Begging for more (rejected). Strong Position: Demonstrating value (accepted). Text: "Leverage Positioning".]**

**[Delivery Note: Frame negotiation as positioning. Show that leverage comes from how you position your value, not from tactics or scripts alone.]**

---

### Slide 180

"Help dramatically increase your compensation..."

---

### Slide 190

"Worst case scenario: The call is free, and even if we can't help you, we'll show you exactly what we would do if we were in your situation to hit your goal..."

---

### Slide 190A: **POSITIONING ASSESSMENT** (NEW)

"On that call, here's what we'll do:

We'll assess your current positioning:
- Which markets should you be targeting?
- How should you position yourself to get recruited?
- What's holding you back from premium offers?

Then we'll give you a custom positioning strategy—whether you work with us or not.

Because once you understand YOUR positioning gaps, you can fix them."

**[Visual Suggestion: Assessment framework showing the positioning evaluation process. Three evaluation areas: Market Positioning, Attraction Positioning, Offer Positioning. Text: "Free Positioning Assessment".]**

**[Delivery Note: Frame the strategy call as a "positioning assessment." This increases perceived value (you're not just selling, you're diagnosing) and reinforces the Big Domino throughout the entire webinar.]**

---

### Slide 195

"And also trying to learn how to make the best companies and hiring managers recruit you for the best, highest paying opportunites..."

---

## 🎯 TIER 1 ENHANCEMENT: Final Close Future Pacing (Slides 195A-195D)

### Slide 195A: "Here's What Happens Next"

"When you click the button below and book your strategy call, here's what happens:

You'll pick a time that works for you—probably sometime in the next 7 days.

Between now and then, you're going to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. That's normal. That's good.

On the day of the call, you'll hop on Zoom with me.

We're going to map out your exact situation—where you are now, where you want to be, what's been holding you back.

And within 45 minutes, you'll have complete clarity."

**[Visual Suggestion: Simple process flow. Step 1: Click button. Step 2: Pick time. Step 3: Zoom call. Step 4: Clarity. Clean, reassuring design.]**

**[Delivery Note: Remove fear and uncertainty about what happens next. Make it concrete and safe. Acknowledge their emotions ("excitement and nervousness") to normalize them.]**

---

### Slide 195B: "How You'll Feel After" + **POSITIONING CLARITY** (MODIFIED)

"You'll walk away from that call feeling one of two things:

EITHER: 'This isn't the right fit for me right now'—and you'll have a clear roadmap of what to do instead. That's valuable.

OR: 'This is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm ready to commit.'

And if that's you, we'll map out your next 90 days together.

**You'll know exactly how to position yourself for $300K+ offers. You'll know exactly what success looks like. You'll know you're making the right decision.**

No pressure. No manipulation. Just clarity on your positioning strategy."

**[Visual Suggestion: Two paths branching from the call. Path 1: "Clear Roadmap" (still valuable). Path 2: "90-Day Positioning Plan" (ideal outcome). Both paths show value.]**

**[Delivery Note: This is the qualification frame that removes sales pressure. They win either way. MODIFIED: Add "positioning strategy" language to reinforce Big Domino. Emphasize "No pressure. No manipulation. Just clarity." - this builds trust.]**

---

### Slide 195C: "45 Days After That Call" + **POSITIONED FOR SUCCESS** (MODIFIED)

"And 45 days after that call—if you decide to work with us—you'll be sitting in your first interview with a company that's excited to meet you.

Not because you applied online and got lucky.

**Because you positioned yourself strategically and they recruited you.**

That's when you'll know this was the right decision.

**That's when you'll see the Positioning Principle working in your life.**"

**[Visual Suggestion: Calendar showing "Day 1: Strategy Call" → "Day 45: First Interview". Interview scene with confident candidate and engaged interviewer. Checkmark: "They recruited YOU." Add: "Positioning Principle in Action".]**

**[Delivery Note: Future pace beyond the call to the first tangible result. 45 days is specific and believable. MODIFIED: Reinforce the positioning/recruitment framework and explicitly tie back to the Big Domino ("Positioning Principle working in your life").]**

---

### Slide 195D: Final CTA

"So click the button below.

Book your call.

**Let's see if strategic positioning is right for you.**

I'll see you on the other side."

[CTA Button: "CLICK HERE TO BOOK YOUR POSITIONING ASSESSMENT"]

**[Visual Suggestion: Clean, prominent CTA button. Three red arrows pointing down (as in original Slide 198). Simple, uncluttered design. Optional: Timer showing "Limited Positioning Assessment Slots Available This Week".]**

**[Delivery Note: Simple, direct, low-pressure. MODIFIED: Change "Let's see if this is right for you" to "Let's see if strategic positioning is right for you" to maintain positioning language consistency. "I'll see you on the other side" creates inevitability and connection.]**

---

### Slide 198 (Original Final CTA - Keep as Backup/Reinforcement)

"CLICK THE BUTTON BELOW, BOOK A CALL, AND APPLY TO SEE IF YOU'RE A GOOD FIT FOR THE ACTIVE OFFER PROGRAM"

[Three red arrows pointing down to CTA buttons]

**[Implementation Note: You can either replace Slide 198 with 195A-195D, OR keep both - using 195A-195D as the primary close and 198 as a reinforcement slide. Testing will determine which performs better.]**

## EXPECTED IMPACT METRICS

### Big Domino Score Improvement
**Before (v1):** 3/10 - No clear Big Domino identified
**After (v3.0):** 7/10 - Positioning Principle clearly established and reinforced throughout

**Why 7/10 and not 10/10:**
- Still using "4 Aha Moments" structure instead of "3 Secrets" (structural issue remains)
- Could be even more provocative with positioning messaging
- Some sections could be tightened for maximum Big Domino impact

**To reach 9/10:** Would need to restructure to 3 Secrets framework (Option 6 from the Big Domino fix options).

### Other Expected Improvements

**Conversion Rate:** 15-25% improvement in webinar-to-call booking rate
- Clear Big Domino creates "must have" urgency
- Positioning framework makes offer feel essential (you're buying a career-long skill)
- Consistent messaging reduces confusion and increases trust

**Perceived Value:** Significant increase
- Positioning Principle elevates from tactics to strategy
- Framing as "career-long skill" vs. "job search help" increases value
- "Positioning Assessment" on call sounds more valuable than "strategy call"

**Objection Handling:** Easier
- "I don't have the skills" → "It's not about skills, it's about positioning"
- "I don't have connections" → "Positioning creates connections"
- "I'm not qualified" → "You're qualified, just mis-positioned"

### Implementation Timeline

**Week 1:**
- Review all new positioning slides (10A-10H, 20A-20J, positioning callbacks)
- Write and rehearse positioning language for smooth delivery
- Create visual designs for new slides matching existing deck style

**Week 2:**
- Integrate new slides into existing deck
- Update slide numbers throughout
- Rehearse complete webinar with positioning emphasis
- Time the webinar (target: 55-60 minutes with positioning additions)

**Testing & Optimization:**
- A/B test v2.2 vs. v3.0 if possible
- Monitor Big Domino resonance (do people cite the Positioning Principle in applications?)
- Track conversion metrics: registration → attendance → call booking → close rate
- Refine positioning language based on audience response

## POSITIONING PRINCIPLE TALKING POINTS (Quick Reference)

Use these exact phrases throughout delivery to reinforce the Big Domino:

1. **"Income is determined by positioning, not performance."**
2. **"It's not about HOW WELL you sell, it's about WHERE you sell."**
3. **"Same skills. Better positioning. 3x income."**
4. **"Positioning beats performance. Every. Single. Time."**
5. **"You don't have a skills problem. You have a positioning problem."**
6. **"Applicants compete. Candidates get chosen."**
7. **"Better boat. Not better paddling."**
8. **"Once you master positioning, $80K-$150K raises become inevitable."**
9. **"Positioning isn't a one-time trick. It's a career-long skill."**
10. **"The highest-paid salespeople aren't the hardest workers. They're the best-positioned workers."**

**Delivery Tip:** Say these phrases EXACTLY as written. Repetition of identical language creates brand recall and belief adoption.

## KEY TALKING POINTS SUMMARY (Updated for Positioning)

### Core Problem (Positioning Lens)

- You have a positioning problem, not a skills problem

### The Big Domino: The Positioning Principle

- **Income is determined by positioning, not performance**
- It's about WHERE you sell, not HOW WELL you sell
- Same skills in different markets = wildly different income

- Positioning is a learnable skill, not luck or connections

### The Positioning Principle Proof

- Personal story: $135K → $400K (same skills, better positioning)
- Darrell: $90K raise through better positioning
- Simon: $90K → $280K (same effort, better positioned)
- Google example: 2,000 applicants (bad positioning) vs. 20 recruited candidates (good positioning)
- Worst salespeople at Salesforce > best salespeople at mid-market (positioning > performance)

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Rehearse the Big Domino**: Practice slides 10A-10H until you can deliver the Positioning Principle with absolute conviction. This is the most important section—if you don't believe it, they won't.

2. **Memorize the Positioning Phrases**: The 10 key phrases listed above should become automatic. Say them identically every time you deliver the webinar.

3. **Visual Design**: The new positioning slides need strong visuals (boat analogy, before/after comparisons, positioning frameworks). Invest in quality design for these slides.

4. **Test the Length**: v3.0 adds ~15-20 minutes to the webinar. Practice pacing to keep it under 60 minutes total, or consider which sections to trim.

### Optional Enhancements (Future Iterations)

1. **Rename the Program**: Consider "The Positioning Method" or "Strategic Positioning Mastery" to fully align program name with Big Domino.

2. **Create Positioning Assessment Tool**: Build a simple online assessment that diagnoses positioning gaps. Offer it as a lead magnet.

3. **Develop "4 Dimensions of Positioning" Content**: Expand the positioning framework into standalone content (blog posts, social media, lead magnets).

4. **Add Positioning Case Studies**: Film video testimonials where students explicitly talk about how they improved their positioning (reinforces the Big Domino).

5. **Consider 3 Secrets Restructure (v4.0)**: If v3.0 performs well, consider full restructure to 3 Secrets framework (Option 6) to reach 9/10 Big Domino score.

---

**Document Status:** v3.0 with Positioning Principle Big Domino Integration
**Enhancement Date:** Based on v2.2 + Big Domino evaluation feedback
**Expected Big Domino Score:** 7/10 (up from 3/10)
**Implementation Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Next Version:** v4.0 could implement 3 Secrets structure for 9/10 score
