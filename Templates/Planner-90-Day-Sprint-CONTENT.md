### The 4 Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
Before you start applying, you need your positioning and materials dialed in. Rushing past this phase leads to wasted effort later.

Key activities:
- Complete self-assessments
- Define target role criteria
- Create/update resume and LinkedIn
- Build target company list
- Set up tracking system

Success metric: All materials ready, 20 target companies identified

---

**Phase 2: Pipeline Building (Weeks 3-6)**
This is where you fill your funnel. The goal is to create enough opportunities that you have options. Most people don't do enough volume here.

Key activities:
- 20+ targeted outreach messages per week
- 10+ applications per week
- Network activation
- Initial conversations

Success metric: 20+ active conversations, first interviews scheduled

---

**Phase 3: Interview Momentum (Weeks 7-10)**
Now you're converting pipeline to interviews. Your focus shifts from quantity to quality - preparing deeply for each conversation.

Key activities:
- 3-5 interviews per week
- Deep company research
- Mock interview practice
- Relationship building with hiring teams

Success metric: 5+ interview processes active, 2+ at final stages

---

**Phase 4: Closing (Weeks 11-13)**
The final push. You're managing multiple offers, negotiating, and making your decision. Don't rush - this is where the money is made.

Key activities:
- Final round interviews
- Offer evaluation
- Negotiation
- Decision and transition

Success metric: Signed offer at target compensation

❌ **Don't:**
- Leave the tracker empty for days

## Page 4: Interpreting Your Metrics

### Healthy Conversion Rates

| Stage | Target Rate | If Below Target |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Applications → Responses | 15-25% | Review resume/application quality |
| Responses → Interviews | 50%+ | Improve initial conversation skills |
| Interview 1 → Interview 2 | 50%+ | Work on interview performance |
| Final → Offer | 30%+ | Evaluate fit or negotiation approach |

### Warning Signs to Watch

🚩 **Red Flags in Your Metrics:**

- **No responses after 30+ applications:** Your resume or targeting is off
- **Conversations but no interviews:** Your positioning or communication needs work
- **Interviews but no advancement:** Practice interview skills, review fit
- **Offers but rejecting them:** Reassess target criteria

### Course Corrections

If metrics are below target for 2+ weeks:
1. Identify the specific bottleneck
2. Review relevant course module
3. Ask for feedback in community
4. Make ONE change and test
5. Give it one week, then reassess
