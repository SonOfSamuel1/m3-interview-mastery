**Section 3 Total: _____ / 20**

### Interpretation

High-paying AE roles typically deliver strongly on:
- ✅ Compensation
- ✅ Growth
- ✅ Autonomy
- ✅ Recognition

They may be weaker on:
- ⚠️ Stability (variable comp)
- ⚠️ Work-Life Balance (quota pressure)

If your top values align with what these roles deliver, you'll likely be fulfilled. If they don't, you may earn well but feel unfulfilled.

### Overall Interpretation

#### 115-145 Points: STRONG FIT ✅

You're well-aligned with high-paying AE roles. Your preferences, skills, and values match what these positions demand and deliver. You're likely to both succeed AND feel fulfilled in a $200k+ role.

**Next Step:** Move forward confidently with the Active Offer program. Focus on execution.

---

#### 90-114 Points: GOOD FIT ✅

You have solid alignment with some areas to consider or develop. The fundamentals are there, but pay attention to where you scored lower.

**Next Step:** Review your lowest-scoring areas. Are these development opportunities or genuine misalignments? If development, proceed with awareness. If misalignment, reflect on whether the tradeoffs are worth it for you.

---

#### 70-89 Points: MODERATE FIT ⚠️

You have meaningful gaps between your current state and what high-paying AE roles require. This doesn't mean you can't succeed, but it means you should be honest about the work ahead.

**Next Step:** Have a candid self-assessment. Are you willing to develop in your gap areas? Are you clear on why you want this despite the mismatches? If yes, proceed with a realistic timeline and expectations.

---

#### Below 70 Points: POTENTIAL MISMATCH 🚩

Your assessment suggests significant misalignment between what you want/offer and what high-paying AE roles demand/deliver. This doesn't mean sales isn't for you - it may mean this specific type of role isn't the best fit.

**Next Step:** Consider whether there's a different sales role type that better matches your profile (e.g., customer success, sales engineering, channel sales, or different market segments). It's better to find the right fit than force one that will leave you frustrated.

### Final Note

Remember: This assessment reveals your starting point, not your ceiling. Many successful $200k+ AEs started with gaps in skills or misaligned preferences that they developed over time. What matters is:

1. **Honest self-awareness** about where you are today
2. **Genuine motivation** to develop where needed
3. **Realistic expectations** about the work required

If you have those three things, gaps can be closed and alignment can be built.

**Ready to start your journey?**

The Active Offer program will give you the system to land a high-paying AE role, but this assessment ensures you're pursuing something that will actually make you happy when you get there.
