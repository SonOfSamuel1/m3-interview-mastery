## Chapter 9: Value Offer: Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part I: Problems \& Solutions

The steps you've mentioned—identifying dream outcomes and listing problems with limiting beliefs—come from **Chapter 9** of Alex Hormozi's "\$100M Offers." This chapter provides a detailed, step-by-step framework for building your Grand Slam Offer. Here is the complete process in detail:[^1][^2][^3]

### The Complete 5-Step Framework

#### Step 1: Identify Dream Outcome

**What this means:** Focus on the actual outcome your customer desires, not the product or service itself. The dream outcome is the destination and experience they want to arrive at, not the journey to get there.[^2][^1]

**Example:** Alex Hormozi's gym example shows he wasn't selling memberships or gym experiences—he was selling the dream outcome of **losing 20 pounds in 6 weeks**. Airlines don't sell plane tickets; they sell vacations.[^3][^1][^2]

**Key insight:** When you're thinking about your dream outcome, it must depict them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience. Paint a vivid, emotionally compelling picture of what success looks like.[^1][^2]

**Additional considerations:**

- Almost all products can be attached to one central desire: **status**. Everyone wants to increase their status or at least not decrease it.[^1]
- The dream outcome represents the gap between the customer's current reality and their dreams.[^1]


#### Step 2: List Problems

**What this means:** Write down all the things people struggle with and their limiting beliefs around achieving the dream outcome.[^2][^1]

**Key guideline:** Think about what happens **immediately before and immediately after** someone uses your product or service. What's the next problem they'll face? List problems in insane detail—the more problems you identify, the more you can solve, and the more valuable your offer becomes.[^3][^2][^1]

**Timing consideration:** List problems that exist before, during, and after using your solution.[^2]

**Linking problems to the Value Equation:** Each problem has four negative elements that correspond directly to the four value drivers:[^2]

- **Dream Outcome Problem:** "This won't be financially worth it" or "Is this truly what I want?"
- **Perceived Likelihood of Achievement Problem:** "It won't work because I've failed before" or "I can't stick with it. External factors will get in my way" (This is the most unique and service-specific problem bucket)
- **Effort \& Sacrifice Problem:** "This will be too hard, too confusing. I won't like it. I'll suck at it."
- **Time Delay Problem:** "This will take too much time. I'm too busy. It won't be convenient for me."

**Example for weight loss (losing 20 pounds in 6 weeks):**

- Buying healthy food is expensive
- Healthy food takes time to prepare
- Eating out will sabotage progress
- Family meals won't support the goal
- Not knowing what workouts to do
- Lack of motivation or discipline
- No accountability
- Not knowing if the approach will work[^3][^1][^2]

**Research tip:** Reflect on past sales efforts and consider why potential clients declined your offer. This provides valuable insights into identifying these challenges.[^4]

#### Step 3: Solutions List (Part 1 - Transform Problems into Solutions)

**What this means:** Turn each identified problem into a solution. The simplest approach is to prepend "How to" to each problem and rephrase it as solution-oriented language.[^3][^1][^2]

**Example transformations:**

- Problem: "Buying healthy food is expensive" → Solution: "How to buy healthy food for less than your current grocery bill"
- Problem: "Healthy food takes too long to prepare" → Solution: "How to prepare healthy meals in 15 minutes or less"
- Problem: "Eating out will sabotage progress" → Solution: "How to eat out and still lose weight"
- Problem: "Not knowing what workouts to do" → Solution: "Structured workout guide tailored for weight loss"[^1][^2][^3]

**Part 2 - Name the solutions:** After transforming problems into solutions, give each one a compelling name that signals value and transformation.[^2][^1]

#### Step 4: Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles ("The How")

**What this means:** Determine how you will actually deliver each solution. This is the most important part of the process because it's what you're offering in exchange for money.[^3][^1][^2]

**Process:**

- Brainstorm all the things you could possibly do to solve each problem you've identified
- Push your limits and consider different versions of the solution you'd normally default to
- Don't restrict yourself to only what you're willing to deliver right now—get creative[^1][^2]

**Different delivery approaches:**

- **One-on-one solution:** Personal coaching, consulting, or mentoring
- **Small group solution:** Group coaching, workshops, or mastermind groups
- **Digital/self-paced solution:** Courses, guides, templates, or software
- **Hybrid solution:** Combination of multiple delivery methods[^2]

**Example for weight loss:**

- How to buy healthy food for less: Provide a grocery guide and discount partnerships
- How to prepare meals quickly: Provide meal prep videos or done-for-you meal plans
- How to eat out and lose weight: Provide restaurant guide and ordering strategy[^1][^2]


#### Step 5a: Trim \& Stack (Select High-Value Solutions)

**What this means:** After identifying all possible solutions and delivery vehicles, you must narrow down to only the highest-value elements that you can realistically deliver.[^3][^2][^1]

**Selection criteria:**

- Look at the **cost to you** of providing each solution (time, resources, complexity)
- Remove low-cost, low-value solutions first
- Then remove high-cost, low-value solutions
- Keep solutions that are: low-cost and high-value, OR high-cost and high-value[^2][^3][^1]

**How to determine value:** Apply the Value Equation to each potential solution and ask yourself:[^2]

- Which solutions increase the dream outcome?
- Which solutions increase perceived likelihood of achievement?
- Which solutions decrease effort and sacrifice?
- Which solutions decrease time delay to results?

Solutions that check multiple boxes are highest value.[^1][^2]

#### Step 5b: Put All the Bundles Together

**What this means:** Bundle all your selected high-value solutions into one ultimate, high-value deliverable.[^3][^1][^2]

**Bundling structure:** Organize your offer as Problem → Solution Wording → Sexier Name for Bundle → Delivery Vehicle.[^3][^1]

**Complete example for weight loss:**


| Problem | Solution Name | Sexy Container Name | Delivery Vehicle |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Don't know what to eat | How to buy healthy food on a budget | Smart Shopper's Guide | PDF guide + pre-curated discount partnerships |
| Healthy food takes too long | How to prepare meals in 15 minutes | Quick-Fire Meal Prep | Video library with 30+ recipes |
| Eating out sabotages progress | How to eat out and keep losing weight | Restaurant Survival Guide | Interactive guide with restaurant-specific strategies |
| Don't know how to work out | How to work out for weight loss | 6-Week Lean Challenge | Video workout program |
| Need accountability | How to stay motivated and accountable | Progress Tracker + Community | Weekly check-ins and private group |

### Key Takeaways for Chapter 9

The entire process flows like this:[^1][^3]

1. **Define** the customer's dream outcome clearly
2. **List** every obstacle and limiting belief in insane detail
3. **Transform** each obstacle into a solution with a compelling name
4. **Brainstorm** all possible delivery vehicles for each solution
5. **Select** only the high-value, feasible solutions to include
6. **Bundle** everything together into one cohesive, premium offer

**Critical insight:** Many offers fail when even a single problem isn't being solved. The comprehensive nature of this process—identifying problems in detail and creating corresponding solutions—is what makes the difference between a mediocre offer and a Grand Slam Offer that makes people feel stupid saying no.[^2][^3][^1]
