# STEP 1: DEFINE THE DREAM OUTCOME

> **Framework Principle:** Focus on the actual outcome your customer desires, not the product or service itself. The dream outcome is the destination and experience they want to arrive at, not the journey to get there.

## 1.1 Dream Outcome Definition

**What is the ultimate destination/experience your ideal customer wants?**

*(Not "complete the Active Offer course" but the actual life transformation they seek)*

```

```

**Paint the vivid picture - what does success look, feel, and mean to them?**

```
FINANCIAL FREEDOM & SECURITY
- Opening their bank app and seeing a $17k+ direct deposit hit every two weeks
- Paying off credit card debt within the first 3 months of the new role
- Building a real emergency fund for the first time in their career
- No longer living commission check to commission check
- Taking their family on a real vacation without checking the budget twice
- Investing in their kids' education funds consistently

WORK-LIFE BALANCE & FREEDOM

- Taking a mental health day without guilt or fear

PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENCE & FULFILLMENT

- Posting the LinkedIn update and watching the congratulations pour in

RELATIONSHIP & LIFE IMPACT
- Their spouse finally stops worrying about money
- Being the example for younger siblings or friends in sales
- Not bringing work stress home every night
- Their kids seeing them happy and balanced, not burned out
- Feeling like a whole person again, not just a quota-carrying machine
```

**Status element - how does achieving this elevate their identity/position?**

```
SELF-PERCEPTION SHIFTS
- Feeling like they finally "made it" in their sales career
- Knowing they can compete with anyone in the industry
- No longer questioning if they're "cut out for sales"
- Seeing themselves as someone who commands premium compensation
- Viewing themselves as someone companies compete to hire

PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION
- Getting congratulatory messages from former colleagues who are impressed
- Being asked for advice by peers still stuck in toxic roles
- Former managers who doubted them seeing their LinkedIn update
- Becoming the person others come to for job search advice

FAMILY & SOCIAL CIRCLE
- Their spouse telling friends "they work for [impressive company]"
- In-laws no longer questioning the stability of their income
- People asking "how did you do it?" instead of "are you okay?"
- Being seen as financially successful without being a doctor/lawyer

INDUSTRY & PEER RECOGNITION
- Being in a role that signals "I play at the highest level"
- Having comp and title that commands respect in negotiations

FUTURE OPTIONALITY
- Having the financial cushion to be selective about future moves
- Being in a position to mentor others coming up behind them

- Being positioned for whatever comes next - startup, leadership, entrepreneurship
```

# STEP 2: LIST ALL PROBLEMS & LIMITING BELIEFS

> **Framework Principle:** Write down all the things people struggle with and their limiting beliefs around achieving the dream outcome. Think about what happens immediately before and immediately after using your solution. More problems identified = more valuable offer.

## 2.1 Brainstorm All Problems

**Pre-Course Problems** *(What they struggle with before finding Active Offer)*

```
[TO BE DEFINED]
```

**During-Process Problems** *(What they'll struggle with during the job search)*

```
[TO BE DEFINED]
```

**Post-Success Problems** *(What could sabotage them after landing the role)*

```
[TO BE DEFINED]
```

## 2.2 Map Problems to Four Value Drivers

### A. Dream Outcome Problems
*"This won't be financially worth it" or "Is this truly what I want?"*

| # | Problem/Limiting Belief |
|---|------------------------|
| 1 | I don't know if I really want this type of role - maybe I'm not cut out for it |
| 2 | What if the OTE is inflated and the quota is impossible? |
| 3 | I'm not sure I want to start over at a new company and lose my tenure |
| 4 | Maybe I should just stay where I am and wait for promotion |
| 5 | I don't know if more money will actually make me happier |
| 6 | What if the company culture is toxic and I'm back to square one? |
| 7 | I'm worried I'll sacrifice work-life balance for the higher comp |

### B. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement Problems
*"It won't work because I've failed before" or "I can't stick with it"*

| # | Problem/Limiting Belief |
|---|------------------------|
| 1 | I've applied to hundreds of jobs and never hear back |
| 2 | I don't have the right experience to land one of these roles |

| 8 | I don't have a college degree from a top school |
| 9 | I'm too old/young for these roles |
| 10 | My sales numbers aren't impressive enough |

| 12 | I don't know what companies are actually good to work for |
| 13 | I've never sold in this industry before |
| 14 | I don't know what hiring managers actually want to hear |

### C. Effort & Sacrifice Problems
*"This will be too hard, too confusing. I won't like it. I'll suck at it."*

| # | Problem/Limiting Belief |
|---|------------------------|
| 1 | Job searching is exhausting on top of my current job |
| 2 | I don't have time to customize applications for every role |
| 3 | Learning new interview frameworks feels overwhelming |
| 4 | I hate self-promotion - talking about myself feels gross |
| 5 | Networking feels fake and transactional |
| 6 | Preparing for interviews takes so much time |
| 7 | I don't want to seem desperate by reaching out to people |
| 8 | I can't afford to take time off for interviews |
| 9 | I don't know what to say in cold outreach |
| 10 | Tracking applications and follow-ups is a mess |
| 11 | I'm afraid of burning bridges if I job search while employed |
| 12 | I don't know how to evaluate if a company is actually good |
| 13 | I don't have the energy after work to job search effectively |

### D. Time Delay Problems
*"This will take too much time. I'm too busy. It won't be convenient."*

| # | Problem/Limiting Belief |
|---|------------------------|
| 1 | I've been job searching for months with no results |
| 2 | Interview processes take 4-6 weeks - I need a job now |
| 3 | I don't have time to build a network from scratch |
| 4 | How long until I actually start making more money? |
| 5 | I can't wait months to figure out what works |
| 6 | I don't know how to speed up the hiring process |
| 7 | I need a system that works now, not in 6 months |
