2. **Pixel-Perfect Control:** Exact brand specifications every time
3. **Automation:** All 57 slides generated consistently in under 2 minutes
4. **Reproducibility:** Source code allows for future modifications
5. **Scalability:** Can easily generate hundreds of slides with same quality

**Alternative Tools Considered:**
- HTML/CSS with Puppeteer (more complex setup)
