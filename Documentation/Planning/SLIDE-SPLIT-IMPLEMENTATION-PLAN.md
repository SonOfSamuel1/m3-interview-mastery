# Slide Split Implementation Plan
## Webinar v4.1 Density Optimization

**Date:** 2025-01-17
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Scope:** 68 slides identified for splitting across 3 phases

---

## Executive Summary

The audit identified 68 text-heavy slides (44% of the 154-slide deck) that exceed optimal density thresholds. Implementing all recommended splits will:

- **Add 60-75 slides** to the deck (154 → 215-230 slides)
- **Reduce average character count** from 180 to 120-130 per slide
- **Improve retention and comprehension** through progressive reveals
- **Increase presentation time** by ~10% (75-90 min → 80-95 min)
- **Enhance conversion** through better pacing and clarity
